<small>HOW THE TEACHING OF MOHAMMED SPREAD INTO MANY
LANDS AND CREATED MANY LITERATURES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> wide-spread Arabic empire and religion originated
with Mohammed and was founded on his book, the
Koran. That tremendously important work, with the primitive
Arabic literature of even earlier date, formed the theme
of our preceding volume. We have now to trace the Arabic
literature and thought which, with the expanding of the
Mohammedan empire, spread over a large part of the Eastern
world. Geographically that empire reached from its Arabian
center eastward through Babylonia and Persia into India,
westward through all North Africa into Spain, southward
through Egypt into the wilds of Central Africa, and northward
through Asia Minor to all the Turkish possessions.
Through much of this vast region, Arabic became the common
speech, and books were written in its tongue. Even in
our own day, Arabic continues as the language of a considerable
part of Turkey in Asia, of Egypt, and of all North
Africa.</p>

<p>We can scarcely, however, regard as a unit all the varying
Mohammedan literatures of these many lands. The
Persians, for example, retained their own language and wrote
in it a literature of Mohammedan religious spirit, so important
that we shall devote to it a later separate volume. Our
present task, therefore, will confine itself to tracing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the Middle Ages the more strictly Arabian development.
This includes first, the spread of literature and thought
among the Arabs themselves, or among those people who
completely adopted the Arabic faith and speech. Second,
it includes the literature of the Moors, or semi-Arabic peoples,
of North Africa and Spain. And third, it leads us to
the Turks, the last Mohammedan conquerors, who took up
and carried on Arabic tradition, though in a language and
spirit more Tartar than Arabian.</p>

<p>For the purely Arabic development, that is for the literature
and thought that sprang directly from Mohammed's
teaching, we turn first to the "Sunan," or traditions about
Mohammed. After the prophet's death in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 632, and
while his followers were spreading his teachings by force of
arms, they talked much of the doings and sayings of their
adored master. Then, long after his own writings had been
gathered in the official form of the Koran, a similar collection
was made of what might be termed his unofficial teaching,
that is of all his remembered words, the ideas which he
had not proclaimed as inspired by God, but had given forth
in ordinary conversation between man and man. The details
of his life were also treasured. Thus sprang up the
"Sunan," from which we may learn as much of Mohammed
the man, and of the daily life and thought of his people, as
from the Koran we learn of Mohammed the poet and of the
poetic spirit of Arabia.</p>

<p>For a long time the Arabs developed no other religious literature
than this. Of the third leader of their new faith,
the Caliph Omar, there is a well-known legend which may be
untrue in fact but is intensely true to the fanatic spirit of the
Caliph and his followers. It says that when Omar's armies
conquered Egypt the scholars of Alexandria entreated him to
protect the books of their great library, the largest in the
world. Instead, Omar ordered the thousands of manuscripts
to be used to feed the fires of the public baths; and he based
the destruction upon this verdict:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> "If these books disagree
with the Koran they are evil; if they agree they are unnecessary."</p>

<p>The Arabic literary spirit was thus compelled to cling to
its old pre-Mohammedan form. That is, it expressed itself
only in brief personal poems, in skilfully phrased epigrams,
satiric couplets, or "rubaiyat," called forth by a sudden occasion.
A collection of the best known of these poems, gathered
from successive ages of gay and dashing singers, is
given at the close of our Arabic section.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, a change came over the victorious
Arab race. The warriors lost their intense religious inspiration.
They fought among themselves for place and power.
The enormous wealth which they had conquered, with its
resulting temptations to luxury and ease and empty vanity,
weakened them, lured them from both the high moral strength
which they had really attained, and from the fanatic frenzy
of faith which had been their pride. They removed the
capital of their empire from the holy cities of Arabia, first
to Damascus and then to Bagdad, the wonderful dream-city
of splendor which they built upon the banks of the ancient
Tigris river.</p>

<p>Under these gorgeous Caliphs of Bagdad, such as Haroun
al Raschid of "Arabian Nights'" fame, a civilization developed
which Mohammed would never have recognized as
his own, which he would indeed have been the first to repudiate.
Unrestrained power bred a callous indifference to
the sufferings of its victims, and even a barbarous delight in
inflicting torture. The tyranny of the ruling classes bred a
corresponding falsity in their helpless but supple servitors.
Truth, the chief virtue in Mohammed's teaching, became unknown
in human intercourse, except as a poetic ideal. From
their priest-king down, through all the ranks of society, men
talked much of the virtues, while surrendering themselves
almost wholly to the passions. One might of course speak
cynically of mankind's having found this somewhat true in
every age, but seldom has the tragic contrast between the
ideal and the actual been brought into such sharp and visible
form as in the medieval world of Bagdad.</p>

<p>From this fertile though unhealthy soil a new literature
sprang up, typical of the time and place. Here were cen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>tered
the wealth and leisure and most of what survived of
the culture of ancient Asia and Africa. So wit and learning
journeyed there as well. At first the new literature found
voice mainly as history or biography, or as a rather crude
form of these collections of anecdotes purporting to give the
virtues and chief events in the lives of former caliphs.
Among the writers of these semi-biographic tales, by far the
most noted and most noteworthy is Masoudi (died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 957).
His huge work, the "Golden Meadows," fills many volumes,
from which we give the most attractive anecdotes. While
such tales must not be taken as genuine history, they teach us
very clearly the spirit of their age.</p>

<p>After these loose histories, a more careful science developed.
The real learning of the Arab scholars of the
eleventh and twelfth centuries far outranked that of their
European and Christian contemporaries. As yet the various
fields of science were scarcely differentiated; the student took
all knowledge for his province. The earliest Arab writer,
who may perhaps be regarded as a genuine historian, in contrast
to the previous romancers, was Al Biruni (973-1048),
whose "Chronology" our volume quotes. But Al Biruni
was far more than an historian; he was a leading scientist of
his day and also a geographer, his work on "India" being
almost as celebrated as his "Chronology." Of even greater
fame in science than Al Biruni was Avicenna (980-1037),
a sort of universal genius, known first as a physician. To
his works on medicine he afterward added religious tracts,
poems, works on philosophy, on logic, on physics, on mathematics,
and on astronomy. He was also a statesman and a
soldier, and he is said to have died of debauchery. He is
famed as the most versatile and brilliant member of a versatile
and brilliant race.</p>

<p>With the increasing freedom of scientific thought and
speech which Avicenna typifies, there sprang up among the
Eastern Mohammedans a new religious impulse. They
began to examine more carefully the faith which they had
before accepted blindly. To this age therefore we owe the
writings of Al Ghazali (1049-1111), whom some of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
countrymen have regarded as second only to Mohammed as a
teacher of their religion. Indeed, it was a common saying
of his day that "If there were still prophets in the world
Al Ghazali would be one."</p>

<p>Western scholars have, some of them, gone still further in
their admiration of Al Ghazali, declaring him to have been
one of the world's greatest thinkers, whom his Mohammedan
contemporaries never sufficiently appreciated, and to whose
high moral stature the Mohammedan world has not even yet
grown up. Among his writings the most interesting and
useful to modern readers is his "Rescuer from Error," a
sort of spiritual autobiography, his account of his own growth
in religious faith. This striking book our volume gives in
full.</p>

<p>From Al Ghazali, or even from before his time, dates
the great flow of commentaries on the Koran. These half-philosophical,
half-fanatical discussions would have seemed
irreligious to the earliest Mohammedan age. The Koran
had been originally accepted as perfect, and therefore as
completely clear. But now the analytic spirit of the Semite
reasserted itself; and even as the Hebrews in their Biblical
commentaries weighed every "and" and "but" and every
carelessly made letter in their Holy Book, so now the
Mohammedan "mullahs," or priests, began to draw deductions
from their law, to interpret and so develop it. Among
these commentators two are chiefly celebrated. Zamakhshari
(1074-1143) was perhaps the most learned and the shrewdest,
but his ideas have seemed to his coreligionists a little too
radical, too independent of Mohammed, daring almost to
question the divine inspiration of the prophet. Therefore
the work of Zamakhshari's more submissive successor of a
century later, Al Baidawi, has gradually superseded the older
book as the favorite exposition of the Koran. The Western
reader, however, will distinctly prefer the independence of
Zamakhshari.</p>

<p>Into the lighter literature of the medieval Arabs we need
not look too far. They had their wholly unreligious and fantastic
romances such as the "Arabian Nights." This famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
work, however, draws largely upon Persian sources. Indeed,
as our later Persian volume will emphasize, most of the pure
romance of later Arab literature is of Persian origin, and
may best be studied in the Persian books. There is, however,
an intermediate class of tale peculiarly Arabian. This
is the mingling of romance with poetry and moral teachings,
just as the earlier historians had mingled it with history.
Most celebrated in this peculiar class of semi-religious, semi-poetic
romances is the work presented in this volume, the
"Assemblies" of Al Hariri (1054-1122). Just as Masoudi
stands to his race for history, Al Biruni for geography,
Avicenna for science, Al Ghazali for philosophy, and Zamakhshari
and Al Baidawi for religious study, so does Al Hariri
stand for literary skill, for brilliancy and humor. His
"Assemblies" is the Arabs' chief purely literary achievement.</p>


<p class="heading">MOORISH LITERATURE</p>

<p>In the year 1258 Bagdad was stormed and conquered by a
Tartar general. It is true that most of the ravaging Tartars
finally adopted the religion of the conquered, and so the
region continued to obey in religious matters a Mohammedan
caliph; but the rule of the Arabs, which had been long undermined
by Persian influences, ended definitely with the fall
of Bagdad. From the time of that disaster we must look
to other lands for the continuation of a semi-Arabic literature.</p>

<p>Chief of the secondary developments from the Arabian
stock was the remarkable and justly celebrated civilization
of the Moors in Spain. The fame of medieval Arabic
scholarship was carried to its climax by these first Mohammedan
invaders of Europe. In the first wild onrush of Arabian
conquest most of Spain was captured in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
712, captured by an army having leaders of pure Arab blood,
but with followers mainly of the semi-Arabic, or Moorish,
people of North Africa. In the year 756 this Moorish kingdom
in Spain broke completely from the Arabian Caliph and
set up a priest-king of its own, a caliph whose capital was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
at Cordova in Spain, and whose connection with the older
Arab world was only one of race and religion and not of empire.
Our Hebraic volume has already spoken of the remarkable
Hebrew writers and philosophers who flourished
within the shelter of this Cordova caliphate. The Arabs
themselves were not less able than their Hebrew servitors.</p>

<p>Here then, under the sunny skies of Southern Spain, far,
far indeed from the first centers of Semitic civilization, was
the last brilliant blossoming of distinctively Semitic thought.
We have in our previous volumes traced the growth of Semitic
thought and of the Semitic religious progress from their
earliest home by the Euphrates river, where the Babylonian
and the desert Arab warred in unrecognized brotherhood of
race. Now we are ready to glance briefly at them in Spain,
the last strong kingdom they were to possess, and the last
literature of note which the Semites, except as scattered members
of other communities, were to give the world.</p>

<p>Among the Arabic writers of Spain the most noted is
the scientist and philosopher, Averroes (1126-1198). To
Mohammedans he is the religious thinker, who strove to
harmonize their faith with the advancing science of a later
day, and who opposed his practical, rational spirit to the
mysticism of Al Ghazali. To the European world he is the
celebrated commentator on that greatest of philosophers,
Aristotle. As the voice of Aristotle, Averroes thus became
the leading teacher and philosopher of his day; he is the
link which connects our present thought and science with
the first splendor of independent inquiry under the Greeks.
The name of Aristotle, the chief scientific teacher of all the
world, is thus united forever with that of the great Arab
teacher, Averroes.</p>

<p>Moorish literature was also a shrine of poetry and romance,
though most of these lighter writings have only been
preserved to us through the Spanish tongue. Our own Washington
Irving found in these Moorish tales an inspiration
for his genius, and has turned many of them into English.
Others will be found included in our volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>


<p class="heading">TURKISH LITERATURE</p>

<p>Of the Turkish literature we need speak but briefly. The
Turks were not Semites, but a Tartar or East Asiatic stock
who, after wandering into Western Asia, accepted the Mohammedan
faith about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1288. At the very moment
when the vast Mohammedan empire was crumbling to pieces,
assailed by pagan Tartar hordes and crusading Christian
armies from without, and withering from spiritual decadence
within, the Turks took up the waning faith, and with the
energy of new and younger converts carried it onward to
the military conquests which built up the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>This new empire soon included geographically most of the
older Arab Empire; but the Turks brought to their new
faith only the dubious glory of victory in war. They added
little, either to its thought or to its literature. They were,
in fact, a nation still semi-barbaric, strong in the natural virtues
of faith and honesty and a rude kindliness, but wholly
lacking in the subtlety and intellectual keenness which could
have advanced Mohammedan thought.</p>

<p>Hence we shall find in their literature, at first, only childish
tales, echoes of the childhood of the world, magic stories
close akin to those of our own fairyland. Then comes a native
poetry, not rising to remarkable heights in any one great
poet, but full of a warm human love of romance and justice.
Later we come to more thoughtful and elaborate writings, but
these incline to deal with the practical world rather than with
that of religion and speculative thought. So that we close
our Turkish section with what is perhaps the most valuable
piece of early Turkish literature, a work of travel, the celebrated
autobiography of Sidi Ali Reis.</p>

<p class="half-title">THE SUNAN</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Sunan, or "traditions," of Mohammed are now
gathered in six books, though two of these are more specifically
called the Sahihs, or "sincere books." These six
works bear to Mohammedanism much the same relation as
the Four Gospels do to Christianity. That is to say, they
are the accounts of the prophet's life as handed down by his
disciples. Of course to the Mohammedans the Sunan are
not the main source of teaching. That is the Koran, which,
as we have seen, is Mohammed's own book, dictated by the
prophet himself. Moreover, the Sunan do not approach
Mohammed with anything like the same accuracy and closeness
with which the Gospels approach Jesus. The Sunan are
slight and fragmentary traditions, gathered from every possible
source at an interval of more than two centuries after
their prophet's death. They have, however, been accepted
as holy books or "canons" of the Mohammedan faith. Much
of the Mohammedan religious law of to-day is founded on
them; and they are taught in all the schools and made the
basis of many a hair-splitting argument about right and
wrong.</p>

<p>Unlike the Christian religion, that of Mohammed sprang
immediately into world-wide power; hence no sooner was the
prophet dead than every companion of the revered teacher,
every listener who had ever heard him speak, narrated to
eager audiences each remembered trifle. Naturally these became
exaggerated in the telling. Moreover, when rival caliphs
fought and slew one another, each claiming rightful heirship
from the prophet, their followers would inevitably invent
traditions to justify each leader's claim. Exaggeration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
if not direct falsehood, soon became inextricably mixed with
fact. When, later on, men tried to set their faith upon a
firmer basis, they sought to sift these manifold traditions and
decide which were worthy of belief.</p>

<p>The first man who set down these sifted traditions in a
book was Al Bukhari. He traveled all over the Arab Empire
to gather all the tales he could, and he continued elaborating
on his book, the first Sahih, until his death in A.D. 870.
Al Bukhari himself tells us that in his travels he gathered
six hundred thousand tales about Mohammed. Of these he
admitted to his Sahih, as being most trustworthy, a little over
seven thousand. The second Sahih, written by a follower
of Al Bukhari, was garnered from three hundred thousand
tales.</p>

<p>Of slightly later date than these two works were the four
Sunan, founded partly on the earlier books, but built upon
a stricter critical analysis of what should be accepted, and
written after an even wider gathering of all the legends of
the empire. Hence the Sunan include the earlier books,
and the entire collection is commonly spoken of by the later
name. When, however, we speak of these Sunan as a "critical"
selection from the million legends, the modern reader
must not think of this as implying modern scientific criticism
and analytical accuracy. Each tale was chiefly accepted on
the ground that, in the series of men by whom it was said
to have been handed down through the generations, all the
men were known and all were of reputed trustworthiness.</p>

<p>That is to say, in an age already become notorious for its
lack of veracity, a superficial confidence in individual veracity,
extending back through many links for over two hundred
years, was accepted as the ultimate proof of truth.</p>

<p>The most widely read and quoted of the Sunan is that of
Abu Da'ud, who sums up his own work by declaring that
only four of all the thousands of religious rules he has gathered
need be remembered by each man for his own religious
guidance. These four laws Abu Da'ud gives as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>

"Actions will be judged according to intentions. The proof
of a Moslem's sincerity is that he pays no heed to that which
is not his business. No man is a true believer unless he
desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.
That which is lawful is clear, and that which is unlawful
likewise, but there are certain doubtful things between the
two, from which it is well to abstain."</p>

<h4>SELECTIONS FROM THE<br />

<big>SUNAN</big><br />

OR, SAYINGS AND TRADITIONS OF MOHAMMED</h4>


<p>When God created the creation he wrote a book, which is
near him upon the sovran throne; and what is written in it is
this: "Verily my compassion overcometh my wrath."</p>

<p>Say not, if people do good to us, we will do good to them,
and if people oppress us, we will oppress them: but resolve
that if people do good to you, you will do good to them, and
if they oppress you, oppress them not again.</p>

<p>God saith: Whoso doth one good act, for him are ten rewards,
and I also give more to whomsoever I will; and whoso
doth ill, its retaliation is equal to it, or else I forgive him;
and he who seeketh to approach me one cubit, I will seek to
approach him two fathoms; and he who walketh toward me,
I will run toward him; and he who cometh before me with
the earth full of sins, but joineth no partner to me, I will
come before him with an equal front of forgiveness.</p>

<p>There are seven people whom God will draw under his
own shadow, on that day when there will be no other shadow:
one a just king; another, who hath employed himself in devotion
from his youth; the third, who fixeth his heart on the
mosque till he return to it; the fourth, two men whose friendship
is to please God, whether together or separate; the fifth,
a man who remembereth God when he is alone, and weepeth;
the sixth, a man who is tempted by a rich and beautiful
woman, and saith, Verily I fear God; the seventh, a man
who hath given alms and concealed it, so that his left hand
knoweth not what his right hand doeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>The most excellent of all actions is to befriend any one on
God's account, and to be at enmity with whosoever is the
enemy of God.</p>

<p>Verily ye are in an age in which if ye abandon one-tenth
of what is ordered, ye will be ruined. After this a time will
come when he who shall observe one-tenth of what is now
ordered will be redeemed.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Concerning Prayer</i></p>

<p>Angels come among you both night and day; then those
of the night ascend to heaven, and God asketh them how they
left his creatures: they say, We left them at prayer, and
we found them at prayer.</p>

<p>The rewards for the prayers which are performed by people
assembled together are double of those which are said at
home.</p>

<p>Ye must not say your prayers at the rising or the setting
of the sun: so when a limb of the sun appeareth, leave your
prayers until her whole orb is up: and when the sun beginneth
to set, quit your prayers until the whole orb hath disappeared;
for, verily she riseth between the two horns of the devil.</p>

<p>No neglect of duty is imputable during sleep; for neglect
can only take place when one is awake: therefore, when
any of you forget your prayers, say them when ye recollect.</p>

<p>When any one of you goeth to sleep, the devil tieth three
knots upon his neck; and saith over every knot, "The night
is long, sleep." Therefore, if a servant awake and remember
God, it openeth one knot; and if he perform the ablution,
it openeth another; and if he say prayers, it openeth the
other; and he riseth in the morning in gladness and purity:
otherwise he riseth in a lethargic state.</p>

<p>When a Moslem performeth the ablution, it washeth from
his face those faults which he may have cast his eyes upon;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and when he washeth his hands, it removeth the faults they
may have committed, and when he washeth his feet, it dispelleth
the faults toward which they may have carried him:
so that he will rise up in purity from the place of ablution.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Charity</i></p>

<p>When God created the earth it began to shake and tremble;
then God created mountains, and put them upon the earth,
and the land became firm and fixed; and the angels were
astonished at the hardness of the hills, and said, "O God, is
there anything of thy creation harder than hills?" and God
said, "Yes, water is harder than the hills, because it breaketh
them." Then the angel said, "O Lord, is there anything
of thy creation harder than water?" He said, "Yes, wind
overcometh water: it doth agitate it and put it in motion."
They said, "O our Lord! is there anything of thy creation
harder than wind?" He said, "Yes, the children of Adam
giving alms: those who give with their right hand, and
conceal from their left, overcome all."</p>

<p>The liberal man is near the pleasure of God and is near
paradise, which he shall enter into, and is near the hearts
of men as a friend, and he is distant from hell; but the niggard
is far from God's pleasure and from paradise, and far
from the hearts of men, and near the fire; and verily a liberal
ignorant man is more beloved by God than a niggardly
worshiper.</p>

<p>A man's giving in alms one piece of silver in his lifetime
is better for him than giving one hundred when about to die.</p>

<p>Think not that any good act is contemptible, though it be
but your brother's coming to you with an open countenance
and good humor.</p>

<p>There is alms for a man's every joint, every day in which
the sun riseth; doing justice between two people is alms; and
assisting a man upon his beast, and with his baggage, is alms;
and pure words, for which are rewards; and answering a
questioner with mildness is alms, and every step which is
made toward prayer is alms, and removing that which is an
inconvenience to man, such as stones and thorns, is alms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>The people of the Prophet's house killed a goat, and the
Prophet said, "What remaineth of it?" They said,
"Nothing but the shoulder; for they have sent the whole to
the poor and neighbors, except a shoulder which remaineth."
The Prophet said, "Nay, it is the whole goat that remaineth
except its shoulder: that remaineth which they have given
away, the rewards of which will be eternal, and what remaineth
in the house is fleeting."</p>

<p>Feed the hungry, visit the sick, and free the captive if he
be unjustly bound.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Fasting</i></p>

<p>A keeper of fasts, who doth not abandon lying and slandering,
God careth not about his leaving off eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Keep fast and eat also, stay awake at night and sleep also,
because verily there is a duty on you to your body, not to
labor overmuch, so that ye may not get ill and destroy yourselves;
and verily there is a duty on you to your eyes, ye must
sometimes sleep and give them rest; and verily there is a duty
on you to your wife, and to your visitors and guests that come
to see you; ye must talk to them; and nobody hath kept fast
who fasted always; the fast of three days in every month is
equal to constant fasting: then keep three days' fast in every
month.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Reading the Koran</i></p>

<p>The state of a Moslem who readeth the Koran is like the
orange fruit, whose smell and taste are pleasant; and that of
a Moslem who doth not read the Koran is like a date which
hath no smell, but a sweet taste; and the condition of any
hypocrite who doth not read the Koran is like the colocynth
which hath no smell, but a bitter taste; and the hypocrite
who readeth the Koran is like the sweet bazil, whose smell
is sweet, but taste bitter.</p>

<p>Read the Koran constantly; I sware by him in the hands
of whose might is my life, verily the Koran runneth away
faster than a camel which is not tied by the leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Labor and Profit</i></p>

<p>Verily the best things which ye eat are those which ye
earn yourselves or which your children earn.</p>

<p>Verily it is better for one of you to take a rope and bring
a bundle of wood upon his back and sell it, in which case
God guardeth his honor, than to beg of people, whether they
give him or not; if they do not give him, his reputation suffereth
and he returneth disappointed; and if they give him,
it is worse than that, for it layeth him under obligations.</p>

<p>A man came to the Prophet, begging of him something, and
the Prophet said, "Have you nothing at home?" He said,
"Yes, there is a large carpet, with one part of which I cover
myself, and spread the other, and there is a wooden cup in
which I drink water." Then the Prophet said, "Bring
me the carpet and the cup." And the man brought them,
and the Prophet took them in his hand, and said, "Who will
buy them?" A man said, "I will take them at one silver
piece." He said, "Who will give more?" This he repeated
twice or thrice. Another man said, "I will take
them for two pieces of silver." Then the Prophet gave the
carpet and cup to that man, and took the two pieces of silver,
and gave them to the helper, and said, "Buy food with one of
these pieces, and give it to your family, that they may make
it their sustenance for a few days; and buy a hatchet with the
other piece and bring it to me." And the man brought it;
and the Prophet put a handle to it with his own hands, and
then said, "Go, cut wood, and sell it, and let me not see you
for fifteen days." Then the man went cutting wood, and
selling it; and he came to the Prophet, when verily he had
got ten pieces of silver, and he bought a garment with part
of it, and food with part. Then the Prophet said, "This
cutting and selling of wood, and making your livelihood by
it, is better for you than coming on the day of resurrection
with black marks on your face."</p>

<p>Acts of begging are scratches and wounds by which a man
woundeth his own face; then he who wisheth to guard his
face from scratches and wounds must not beg, unless that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
man asketh from his prince, or in an affair in which there is
no remedy.</p>

<p>The Prophet hath cursed ten persons on account of wine:
one, the first extractor of the juice of the grape for others;
the second, for himself; the third, the drinker of it; the
fourth, the bearer of it; the fifth, the person to whom it is
brought; the sixth, the waiter; the seventh, the seller of it;
the eighth, the eater of its price; the ninth, the buyer
of it; the tenth, that person who hath purchased it for
another.</p>

<p>Merchants shall be raised up liars on the day of resurrection,
except he who abstaineth from that which is unlawful,
and doth not swear falsely, but speaketh true in the price
of his goods.</p>

<p>The taker of interest and the giver of it, and the writer of
its papers and the witness to it, are equal in crime.</p>

<p>The holder of a monopoly is a sinner and offender.</p>

<p>The bringers of grain to the city to sell at a cheap rate
gain immense advantage by it, and he who keepeth back grain
in order to sell at a high rate is cursed.</p>

<p>He who desireth that God should redeem him from the
sorrows and difficulties of the day of resurrection must delay
in calling on poor debtors, or forgive the debt in part or whole.</p>

<p>A martyr shall be pardoned every fault but debt.</p>

<p>Whosoever has a thing with which to discharge a debt, and
refuseth to do it, it is right to dishonor and punish him.</p>

<p>A bier was brought to the Prophet, to say prayers over it.
He said, "Hath he left any debts?" They said, "Yes."
He said, "Hath he left anything to discharge them?" They
said, "No." The Prophet said, "Say ye prayers over him;
I shall not."</p>

<p>Give the laborer his wage before his perspiration be dry.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Fighting for the Faith</i></p>

<p>We came out with the Prophet, with a part of the army,
and a man passed by a cavern in which were water and verdure,
and he said in his heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> "I shall stay here, and retire
from the world." Then he asked the Prophet's permission to
live in the cavern; but he said, "Verily I have not been sent
on the Jewish religion, nor the Christian, to quit the delights
of society; but I have been sent on the religion inclining to
truth, and that which is easy, wherein is no difficulty or austerity.
I swear by God, in whose hand is my life, that
marching about morning and evening to fight for religion is
better than the world and everything that is in it: and verily
the standing of one of you in the line of battle is better than
supererogatory prayers performed in your house for sixty
years."</p>

<p>When the Prophet sent an army out to fight, he would say,
March in the name of God and by his aid and on the religion
of the Messenger of God. Kill not the old man who can not
fight, nor young children nor women; and steal not the spoils
of war, but put your spoils together; and quarrel not among
yourselves, but be good to one another, for God loveth the
doer of good.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Judgments</i></p>

<p>The first judgment that God will pass on man at the day of
resurrection will be for murder.</p>

<p>Whosoever throweth himself from the top of a mountain
and killeth himself is in hell fire forever; and whosoever
killeth himself with iron, his iron shall be in his hand, and
he will stab his belly with it in hell fire everlastingly.</p>

<p>No judge must decide between two persons whilst he is
angry.</p>

<p>There is no judge who hath decided between men, whether
just or unjust, but will come to God's court on the day of
resurrection held by the neck by an angel; and the angel will
raise his head toward the heavens and wait for God's orders;
and if God ordereth to throw him into hell, the angel will do
it from a height of forty years' journey.</p>

<p>Verily there will come on a just judge at the day of resurrection
such fear and horror, that he will wish, Would to God
that I had not decided between two persons in a trial for a
single date.</p>

<p class="heading"><i>Of Women and Slaves</i></p>

<p>The world and all things in it are valuable, but the most
valuable thing in the world is a virtuous woman.</p>

<p>I have not left any calamity more hurtful to man than
woman.</p>

<p>A Moslem can not obtain (after righteousness) anything
better than a well-disposed, beautiful wife: such a wife as,
when ordered by her husband to do anything, obeyeth; and if
her husband look at her, is happy; and if her husband swear
by her to do a thing, she doth it to make his oath true; and
if he be absent from her, she wisheth him well in her own
person by guarding herself from inchastity, and taketh care
of his property.</p>

<p>Verily the best of women are those who are content
with little.</p>

<p>Admonish your wives with kindness; for women were created
out of a crooked rib of Adam, therefore if ye wish to
straighten it, ye will break it; and if ye let it alone, it will
be always crooked.</p>

<p>Every woman who dieth, and her husband is pleased with
her, shall enter into paradise.</p>

<p>That which is lawful but disliked by God is divorce.</p>

<p>A woman may be married by four qualifications: one, on
account of her money; another, on account of the nobility of
her pedigree; another, on account of her beauty; a fourth, on
account of her faith; therefore look out for religious women,
but if ye do it from any other consideration, may your hands
be rubbed in dirt.</p>

<p>A widow shall not be married until she be consulted; nor
shall a virgin be married until her consent be asked, whose
consent is by her silence.</p>

<p>When the Prophet was informed that the people of Persia
had made the daughter of Chosroes their queen, he said,
The tribe that constitutes a woman its ruler will not find redemption.</p>

<p>Do not prevent your women from coming to the mosque;
but their homes are better for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>O assembly of women, give alms, although it be of your
gold and silver ornaments; for verily ye are mostly of hell
on the day of resurrection.</p>

<p>When ye return from a journey and enter your town at
night, go not to your houses, so that your wives may have time
to comb their disheveled hair.</p>

<p>God has ordained that your brothers should be your slaves:
therefore him whom God hath ordained to be the slave of his
brother, his brother must give him of the food which he eateth
himself, and of the clothes wherewith he clotheth himself,
and not order him to do anything beyond his power, and if he
doth order such a work, he must himself assist him in doing
it.</p>

<p>He who beateth his slave without fault, or slappeth him in
the face, his atonement for this is freeing him.</p>

<p>A man who behaveth ill to his slave will not enter into
paradise.</p>

<p>Forgive thy servant seventy times a day.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Dumb Animals</i></p>

<p>Fear God in respect of animals: ride them when they are
fit to be ridden, and get off when they are tired.</p>

<p>A man came before the Prophet with a carpet, and said,
"O Prophet! I passed through a wood, and heard the voices
of the young of birds; and I took and put them into my carpet;
and their mother came fluttering round my head, and I
uncovered the young, and the mother fell down upon them,
then I wrapped them up in my carpet; and there are the
young which I have." Then the Prophet said, "Put them
down." And when he did so, their mother joined them:
and the Prophet said, "Do you wonder at the affection of
the mother toward her young? I swear by him who hath
sent me, verily God is more loving to his servants than the
mother to these young birds. Return them to the place from
which ye took them, and let their mother be with them."</p>

<p>Verily there are rewards for our doing good to dumb animals,
and giving them water to drink. An adulteress was
forgiven who passed by a dog at a well; for the dog was hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>ing
out his tongue from thirst, which was near killing him;
and the woman took off her hoot, and tied it to the end of
her garment, and drew water for the dog, and gave him to
drink; and she was forgiven for that act.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Hospitality</i></p>

<p>When a man cometh into his house and remembereth God
and repeateth his name at eating his meals, the devil saith
to his followers, "Here is no place for you to stay in to-night,
nor is there any supper for you." And when a man cometh
into his house without remembering God's name, the devil
saith to his followers, "You have got a place to spend the
night in."</p>

<p>Whosoever believeth in God and the day of resurrection
must respect his guest, and the time of being kind to him is
one day and one night, and the period of entertaining him is
three days, and after that, if he doth it longer, he benefiteth
him more. It is not right for a guest to stay in the house of
the host so long as to inconvenience him.</p>

<p>I heard this, that God is pure, and loveth purity; and God
is liberal, and loveth liberality; God is munificent, and loveth
munificence: then keep the courts of your house clean, and
do not be like Jews who do not clean the courts of their
houses.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Government</i></p>

<p>Government is a trust from God, and verily government
will be at the day of resurrection a cause of inquiry, unless
he who hath taken it be worthy of it and have acted justly
and done good.</p>

<p>Verily a king is God's shadow upon the earth; and every
one oppressed turneth to him: then when the king doeth justice,
for him are rewards and gratitude from his subjects:
but, if the king oppresseth, on him is his sin, and for the oppressed
resignation.</p>

<p>That is the best of men who disliketh power. Beware!
ye are all guardians; and ye will be asked about your subjects:
then the leader is the guardian of the subject, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
will be asked respecting the subject; and a man is a shepherd
to his own family, and will be asked how they behaved, and
his conduct to them; and a wife is guardian to her husband's
house and children, and will be interrogated about them; and
a slave is a shepherd to his master's property, and will be
asked about it, whether he took good care of it or not.</p>

<p>There is no prince who oppresseth the subject and dieth,
but God forbiddeth paradise to him.</p>

<p>If a negro slave is appointed to rule over you, hear him,
and obey him, though his head should be like a dried grape.</p>

<p>There is no obedience due to sinful commands, nor to any
other than what is lawful.</p>

<p>O Prophet of God, if we have princes over us, wanting our
rights, and withholding our rights from us, then what do you
order us? He said, "Ye must hear them and obey their
orders: it is on them to be just and good, and on you to be
obedient and submissive."</p>

<p>He is not strong or powerful who throws people down, but
he is strong who withholds himself from anger.</p>

<p>When one of you getteth angry, he must sit down, and if
his anger goeth away from sitting, so much the better; if not,
let him lie down.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Vanities and Sundry Matters</i></p>

<p>The angels are not with the company with which is a dog,
nor with the company with which is a bell.</p>

<p>A bell is the devil's musical instrument.</p>

<p>The angels do not enter a house in which is a dog, nor that
in which there are pictures.</p>

<p>Every painter is in hell fire; and God will appoint a person
at the day of resurrection for every picture he shall have
drawn, to punish him, and they will punish him in hell.
Then if you must make pictures, make them of trees and
things without souls.</p>

<p>Whosoever shall tell a dream, not having dreamed, shall be
put to the trouble at the day of resurrection of joining two
barleycorns; and he can by no means do it; and he will be
punished. And whosoever listeneth to others' conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
who dislike to be heard by him, and avoid him, boiling lead
will be poured into his ears at the day of resurrection. And
whosoever draweth a picture shall be punished by ordering
him to breathe a spirit into it, and this he can never do, and so
he will be punished as long as God wills.</p>

<p>O servants of God, use medicine: because God hath not
created a pain without a remedy for it, to be the means of
curing it, except age; for that is a pain without a remedy.</p>

<p>He who is not loving to God's creatures and to his own children,
God will not be loving to him.</p>

<p>The truest words spoken by any poet are those of Lebid,
who said, "Know that everything is vanity except God."</p>

<p>Verily he who believeth fighteth with his sword and tongue:
I swear by God, verily abuse of infidels in verse is worse to
them than arrows.</p>

<p>Meekness and shame are two branches of faith, and vain
talking and embellishing are two branches of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The calamity of knowledge is forgetfulness, and to lose
knowledge is this, to speak of it to the unworthy.</p>

<p>Who pursueth the road to knowledge, God will direct
him to the road of paradise; and verily the angels spread their
arms to receive him who seeketh after knowledge; and everything
in heaven and earth will ask grace for him; and verily
the superiority of a learned man over a mere worshiper is like
that of the full moon over all the stars.</p>

<p>Hearing is not like seeing: verily God acquainted Moses of
his tribe's worshiping a calf, but he did not throw down the
tables; but when Moses went to his tribe, and saw with his
eyes the calf they had made, he threw down the tables and
broke them.</p>

<p>Be not extravagant in praising me, as the Christians are in
praising Jesus, Mary's Son, by calling him God, and the
Son of God; I am only the Lord's servant; then call me the
servant of God, and his messenger.</p>

<p>It was asked, "O Messenger of God, what relation is most
worthy of doing good to?" He said, "Your mother"; this
he repeated thrice:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> "and after her your father, and after him
your other relations by propinquity."</p>

<p>God's pleasure is in a father's pleasure, and God's displeasure
is a father's displeasure.</p>

<p>Verily one of you is a mirror to his brother: Then if he
see a vice in his brother he must tell him to get rid of it.</p>

<p>The best person near God is the best among his friends;
and the best of neighbors near God is the best person in his
own neighborhood.</p>

<p>Deliberation in undertaking is pleasing to God, and haste
is pleasing to the devil.</p>

<p>The heart of the old is always young in two things: in love
for the world, and length of hope.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of Death</i></p>

<p>Wish not for death any one of you; either a doer of good
works, for peradventure he may increase them by an increase
of life; or an offender, for perhaps he may obtain the forgiveness
of God by repentance.</p>

<p>When the soul is taken from the body, the eyes follow it,
and look toward it: on this account the eyes remain open.</p>

<p>When a believer is nearly dead, angels of mercy come,
clothed in white silk garments, and say to the soul of the
dying man, "Come out, O thou who art satisfied with God,
and with whom he is satisfied; come out to rest, which is
with God, and the sustenance of God's mercy and compassion,
and to the Lord, who is not angry." Then the soul
cometh out like the smell of the best musk, so that verily it is
handed from one angel to another, till they bring it to the
doors of the celestial regions. Then the angels say, "What
a wonderful, pleasant smell this is which is come to you
from the earth!" Then they bring it to the souls of the
faithful, and they are very happy at its coming; more than
ye are at the coming of one of your family after a long journey.
And the souls of the faithful ask it, "What hath such
a one done, and such a one? how are they?" and they mention
the names of their friends who are left in the world.
And some of them say, "Let it alone; do not ask it, because
it was grieved in the world, and came from thence aggrieved;
ask it when it is at rest." Then the soul saith when it is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
ease, "Verily such a one about whom ye ask is dead." And
as they do not see him among themselves, they say to one another,
"Surely he was carried to his mother, which is hell
fire."</p>

<p>And verily when an infidel is near death, angels of punishment
come to him, clothed in sackcloth, and say to his
soul, "Come out, thou discontented, and with whom God is
displeased; come to God's punishments." Then it cometh
out with a disagreeable smell, worse than the worst stench of
a dead body, until they bring it upon the earth, and they say,
"What an extraordinarily bad smell this is"; till they bring
it to the souls of the infidels.</p>

<p>A bier was passing, and the Prophet stood up for it; and
we stood with him and said, "O Prophet! verily this bier is
of a Jewish woman; we must not respect it." Then the
Prophet said, "Verily death is dreadful: therefore when ye
see a bier, stand up."</p>

<p>Do not abuse or speak ill of the dead, because they have
arrived at what they sent before them; they have received the
rewards of their actions; if the reward is good, you must not
mention them as sinful; and if it is bad, perhaps they may be
forgiven, but if not, your mentioning their badness is of no
use.</p>

<p>Sit not upon graves, nor say your prayers fronting them.</p>

<p>Whoso consoleth one in misfortune, for him is a reward
equal to that of the sufferer.</p>

<p>Whoso comforteth a woman who has lost her child will
be covered with a garment in paradise.</p>

<p>The Prophet passed by graves in Medina, and turned his
face toward them, and said, "Peace be to you, O people of
the graves. God forgive us and you! Ye have passed on
before us, and we are following you."</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Of the State after Death</i></p>

<p>To whomsoever God giveth wealth, and he doth not perform
the charity due from it, his wealth will be made into the
shape of a serpent on the day of resurrection, which shall not
have any hair upon its head, and this is a sign of its poison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and long life, and it hath two black spots upon its eyes, and
it will be twisted round his neck like a chain on the day of
resurrection; then the serpent will seize the man's jaw-bones,
and will say, "I am thy wealth, the charity for which thou
didst not give, and I am thy treasure, from which thou didst
not separate any alms."</p>

<p>The Prophet asked us, "Did any one of you dream?"
We said, "No." He said, "But I did. Two men came to
me and took hold of my hands, and carried me to a pure land:
and behold, there was a man sitting and another standing:
the first had an iron hook in his hand, and was hooking the
other in the lip, and split it to the back of the neck, and then
did the same with the other lip. While this was doing the
first healed, and the man kept on from one lip to the other.
I said, 'What is this?' They said, 'Move on,' and we
did so till we reached a man sleeping on his back, and another
standing at his head with a stone in his hand, with
which he was breaking the other's head, and afterward rolled
the stone about and then followed it, and had not yet returned,
when the man's head was healed and well. Then he
broke it again, and I said, 'What is this?' They said,
'Walk on'; and we walked, till we came to a hole like an
oven, with its top narrow and its bottom wide, and fire was
burning under it, and there were naked men and women in
it; and when the fire burned high the people mounted also,
and when the fire subsided they subsided also. Then I said,
'What is this?' They said, 'Move on'; and we went on till
we came to a river of blood, with a man standing in the middle
of it, and another man on the bank, with stones in his
hands: and when the man in the river attempted to come out,
the other threw stones in his face, and made him return.
And I said, 'What is this'? They said, 'Advance'; and
we moved forward, till we arrived at a green garden, in which
was a large tree, and an old man and children sitting on the
roots of it, and near it was a man lighting a fire. Then I
was carried upon the tree, and put into a house which was
in the middle of it—a better house I have never seen: and
there were old men, young men, women, and children. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
that they brought me out of the house and carried me to the
top of the tree, and put me into a better house, where were
old men and young men. And I said to my two conductors,
'Verily ye have shown me a great many things to-night, then
inform me of what I have seen.' They said, 'Yes: as to
the man whom you saw with split lips, he was a liar, and
will be treated in that way till the day of resurrection; and
the person you saw getting his head broken is a man whom
God taught the Koran, and he did not repeat it in the night,
nor practise what is in it by day, and he will be treated
as you saw till the day of resurrection; and the people you saw
in the oven are adulterers; and those you saw in the river
are receivers of usury; and the old man you saw under the
tree is Abraham; and the children around them are the
children of men: and the person who was lighting the fire was
Malik, the keeper of hell; and the first house you entered
was for the common believers; and as to the second house, it is
for the martyrs: and we who conducted you are one of us
Gabriel, and the other Michael; then raise up your head';
and I did so, and saw above it as it were a cloud: and they
said, 'That is your dwelling.' I said, 'Call it here, that I
may enter it'; and they said, 'Verily your life remaineth,
but when you have completed it, you will come into your
house.'"</p>

<p>When God created paradise, he said to Gabriel, "Go and
look at it"; then Gabriel went and looked at it and at the
things which God had prepared for the people of it. After
that Gabriel came and said, "O my Lord! I swear by thy
glory no one will hear a description of paradise but will be
ambitious of entering it." After that God surrounded paradise
with distress and troubles, and said, "O Gabriel, go and
look at paradise." And he went and looked, and then returned
and said, "O my Lord, I fear that verily no one will
enter it." And when God created hell fire he said to Gabriel,
"Go and take a look at it." And he went and looked at it,
and returned and said, "O my Lord, I swear by thy glory
that no one who shall hear a description of hell fire will wish
to enter it." Then God surrounded it with sins, desires, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
vices; after that he said to Gabriel, "Go and look at hell
fire," and he went and looked at it, and said, "O my Lord,
I swear by thy glory I am afraid that every one will enter
hell, because sins are so sweet that there is none but will
incline to them."</p>

<p>If ye knew what I know of the condition of the resurrection
and futurity, verily ye would weep much and laugh little.</p>

<p>Then I said, "O messenger of God! shall we perish while
the virtuous are among us?" He said, Yes, when the wickedness
shall be excessive, verily there will be tribes of my
sects that will consider the wearing of silks and drinking
liquor lawful, and will listen to the lute: and there will be
men with magnificent houses, and their milch-animals will
come to them in the evening, full of milk, and a man will
come begging a little and they will say, Come to-morrow.
Then God will quickly send a punishment upon them, and
will change others into the shape of monkeys and swine, unto
the day of resurrection.</p>

<p>Verily among the signs of the resurrection will be the taking
away of knowledge from among men; and their being in
great ignorance and much wickedness and much drinking
of liquor, and diminution of men, and there being many
women; to such a degree that there will be fifty women to
one man, and he will work for a livelihood for the women.</p>

<p>How can I be happy, when Israfil hath put the trumpet to

<p>The first thing which God created was a pen, and he said

<p>There is not one among you whose sitting-place is not

companions said, "O Prophet! since God hath appointed
our place, may we confide in this and abandon our religious
and moral duty?" He said, "No, because the happy will
do good works, and those who are of the miserable will do bad
works."</p>

<p>The Prophet of God said that Adam and Moses (in the
world of spirits) maintained a debate before God, and Adam
got the better of Moses; who said, "Thou art that Adam
whom God created by the power of his hands, and breathed
into thee from his own spirit, and made the angels bow before
thee, and gave thee an habitation in his own paradise: after
that thou threwest man upon the earth, from the fault which
thou committedst." Adam said, "Thou art that Moses
whom God elected for his prophecy, and to converse with,
and he gave to thee twelve tables, in which are explained
everything, and God made thee his confidant, and the bearer
of his secrets: then how long was the Bible written before I
was created?" Moses said, "Forty years." Then Adam
said, "Didst thou see in the Bible that Adam disobeyed
God?" He said, "Yes." Adam said, "Dost thou then
reproach me on a matter which God wrote in the Bible forty
years before creating me?"</p>

<p>Ayesha relates that the Prophet said to her, "Do you

of Ramadan). I said, "What is it, O Prophet?"
He said, "One thing in this night is, that all the children
of Adam to be born in the year are written down; and also
those who are to die in it, and all the actions of the children
of Adam are carried up to heaven in this night; and their
allowances are sent down." Then I said, "O Prophet, do
none enter Paradise except by God's mercy?" He said,
"No, none enter except by God's favor": this he said thrice.
I said, "You, also, O Prophet! will you not enter into paradise,
excepting by God's compassion?" Then the Prophet
put his hand on his head, and said, "I shall not enter, except
God cover me with his mercy": this he said thrice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>A man asked the Prophet what was the mark whereby a
man might know the reality of his faith. He said, "If thou
derive pleasure from the good which thou hast done, and be
grieved for the evil which thou hast committed, thou art a
true believer." The man said, "What doth a fault really
consist in?" He said, "When anything pricketh thy conscience,
forsake it."</p>

<p>I am no more than man: when I order you anything with
respect to religion, receive it; and when I order you about
the affairs of the world, then I am nothing more than man.</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the early chronicles of the Arabs, as we have
already stated, by far the most celebrated is the many-volumed
work of Masoudi, called, the "Book of Golden
Meadows." It is a collection of interesting and sometimes
scandalous anecdotes about anything and everything in the
past, but chiefly about the earlier caliphs. These, with true
Eastern subtlety, Masoudi criticises where criticism will be
safe, in order that he may praise with a convincing air where
he thinks praise will be especially pleasing to the powerful
of his own day. In other words, the author is an accomplished
courtier as well as a witty and entertaining writer.
His book begins, as do all Arab books, with the formula,
"In the name of the most merciful God," followed by the
usual preface praising Mohammed and the author's own
work, and explaining its origin. Then follow, chronologically
arranged, the anecdotes of which we quote some that
refer to the best-known caliphs.</p>

<p>Masoudi himself was of the genuine Arab blood, a man of
prominence descended from one of the comrades of Mohammed.
He was born at Bagdad, but was, like many of
his countrymen, a wanderer. After visiting all lands, he
finally selected Egypt as his dwelling-place, and there died,
probably in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 957. Al Bukhari and other earlier travelers
had collected all the tales of the Prophet, so Masoudi
devoted himself to gathering other legends. From the vast
bulk of these he made a thirty-volume historical work, most
of which has disappeared. He then selected from this the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
material for a briefer work, and then, by a third process
of distillation, gathered the best of his anecdotes into the
"Golden Meadows."</p>

<p>Of the more careful historians and genuine scientists who
followed, Avicenna, from whose philosophical work we give
an extract here, must assuredly be ranked the first.</p>

<h5>THE CALIPHATE OF ABU BEKR, THE TRUTHFUL</h5>

<p>Abu Bekr surpassed all the Mohammedans in his austerity,
his frugality, and the simplicity of his life and outward
appearance. During his rule he wore but a single linen
garment and a cloak. In this simple dress he gave audience
to the chiefs of the noblest Arab tribes and to the kings of
Yemen. The latter appeared before him dressed in richest
robes, covered with gold embroideries and wearing splendid
crowns. But at sight of the Caliph, shamed by his mingling
of pious humility and earnest gravity, they followed his example
and renounced their gorgeous attire.</p>


<h5>THE CALIPHATE OF AL MANSUR, THE BUILDER OF BAGDAD</h5>

<p>Al Mansur, the third Caliph of the house of Abbas, succeeded
his brother Es-Saffah ("'the blood-shedder") <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
754. He was a prince of great prudence, integrity, and
discretion; but these good qualities were sullied by his extraordinary
covetousness and occasional cruelty. He patronized
poets and learned men, and was endowed with a
remarkable memory. It is said that he could remember a
poem after having only once heard it. He also had a slave
who could commit to memory anything that he had heard
twice, and a slave-girl who could do the same with what she
had heard three times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>One day there came to him a poet bringing a congratulatory
ode, and Al Mansur said to him: "If it appears that
anybody knows it by heart, or that any one composed it—that
is to say, that it was brought here by some other person
before thee—will give thee no recompense for it; but if
no one knows it, we will give thee the weight in money of
that upon which it is written."</p>

<p>So the poet repeated his poem, and the Caliph at once
committed it to memory, although it contained a thousand
lines. Then he said to the poet: "Listen to it from me,"
and he recited it perfectly. Then he added: "And this
slave, too, knows it by heart." This was the case, as he had
heard it twice, once from the poet and once from the Caliph.
Then the Caliph said: "And this slave-girl, who is concealed
by the curtain, she also recollects it." So she repeated
every letter of it, and the poet went away unrewarded.</p>

<p>Another poet, El Asmaïy, was among the intimate friends
and table-companions of the Caliph. He composed some
very difficult verses, and scratched them upon a fragment of
a marble pillar, which he wrapped in a cloak and placed on
the back of a camel. Then he disguised himself like a
foreign Arab, and fastened on a face-cloth, so that nothing
was visible but his eyes, and came to the Caliph and said:
"Verily I have lauded the Commander of the Faithful in a
'Kasidah'" (ode).</p>

<p>Then said Al Mansur: "O brother of the Arabs! if the
poem has been brought by any one beside thee, we will give
thee no recompense for it; otherwise we will bestow on thee
the weight in money of that upon which it is written." So
El Asmaïy recited the Kasidah, which, as it was extraordinarily
intricate and difficult, the Caliph could not commit
to memory. He looked toward the slave and the girl, but
they had neither of them learned it. So he cried: "O
brother of the Arabs! bring hither that whereon it is written,
that we may give thee its weight."</p>

<p>Then said the seeming Arab:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> "O my Lord! of a truth I
could find no paper to write it upon; but I had amongst the
things left me at my father's death a piece of a marble column
which had been thrown aside as useless, so I scratched
the Kasidah upon that."</p>

<p>Then the Caliph had no help for it but to give him its
weight in gold, and this nearly exhausted his treasury. The
poet took it and departed.</p>

<p>When he had gone away, the Caliph said: "It forces itself
upon my mind that this is El Asmaïy." So he commanded
him to be brought back, and lo! it was El Asmaïy,
who said: "O Commander of the Faithful! verily the poets
are poor and are fathers of families, and thou dost debar
them from receiving anything by the power of thy memory
and the memories of this slave and this slave-girl. But wert
thou to bestow upon them what thou couldst easily spare,
they might with it support their families, and it could not
injure thee."</p>

<p>One day the poet Thalibi recited an ode in the presence
of Al Mansur, hoping for a reward. When he had finished,
the Caliph said to him: "Will you have three hundred dinars
from my treasury, or hear three wise sayings from my lips?"
"Oh," said the poet, anxious to curry favor with his master,
"durable wisdom is better than transitory treasure." "Very
well," said the Caliph, "the first word of wisdom is: When
your garment is worn, don't sew on a new patch, for it looks
badly." "Alas! alas!" wailed the poet, "there go a hundred
dinars at one blow." The Caliph smiled, and continued:
"The second piece of advice is: When you anoint
your beard, don't anoint the bottom of it, lest you soil your
clothes." "Ah!" sighed the poet, "there go the second
hundred." Again the Caliph smiled, and continued: "The
third piece of advice-—-" "O Caliph," cried the poet in an
agony: "keep the third piece of advice to yourself and let
me have the last hundred dinars." Then the Caliph laughed
outright and ordered five hundred dinars to be paid him from
the treasury.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Al Mansur and Abu Muslim</i></p>

<p>Abu Muslim was one of the chief generals of Es-Saffah,
Al Mansur's brother and predecessor. On his accession Al<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Mansur became jealous of Abu Muslim's great power and
influence, but sent him notwithstanding to put down a revolt
raised by Abd Allah, the son of Ali. After several battles,
Abd Allah fled and took refuge in Bassorah, the whole of
his camp and treasure falling into the hands of Abu Muslim.
Al Mansur sent Yaktin bin Musa to take charge of the treasure.
On appearing before Abu Muslim, Yaktin said to him:
"Peace be to thee, Emir!" "A murrain on thee, son of a
prostitute!" answered the general. "They can use me to
shed my blood, but not to guard a treasure." "My lord,"
answered the messenger, "what has put such thoughts into
your head?" "Has not thy master," answered Abu Muslim,
"sent thee to confiscate all the treasure which has come
into my possession?" "May my wife be divorced forever,"
said the Caliph's agent, "if he has not sent me simply
and solely to congratulate you upon your victory and success!"
On these words Abu Muslim embraced him and made
him sit by his side. Notwithstanding this, however, when he
had bidden him farewell, he said to his officers: "By Allah!
I know this man will divorce his wife, simply out of fidelity
to his master."</p>

<p>When he had resolved to revolt against Al Mansur, Abu
Muslim left Mesopotamia, and set out for Khorassan; while
on his part Al Mansur left Anbar, and encamped near the
city of Rumiyeh. From thence he sent the following message
to Abu Muslim: "I wish to consult you on matters
which can not be confided to a letter; come hither, and I shall
not detain you long." Abu Muslim read the letter, but
would not go. Al Mansur then sent to him Djerir, son of
Yezid, the most accomplished diplomatist of his time, who
had already made the acquaintance of Abu Muslim in
Khorassan.</p>

<p>When Djerir came into Abu Muslim's presence, he addressed
him as follows:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> "My lord, you have fought hitherto
faithfully for the Abbassides (Al Mansur's family); why
should you now turn against them? No information has
reached the Caliph which should inspire you with any sort
of fear; you have really, in my belief, no reason to pursue
this line of conduct." Abu Muslim was on the point of
promising to return with him, when one of his intimates
pressed him not to do so. "My friend," the chief answered
him, "I can resist the suggestions of the devil, but not those
of a man like this." And in fact Djerir did not cease his
persuasions till he had induced him to proceed to the Caliph.</p>

<p>Abu Muslim had consulted astrologers, who told him that
he was to destroy a dynasty, create a dynasty,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and be slain
in the land of Rum (Asia Minor). Al Mansur was then at
Rumaiyat al-Madain, a place founded by one of the Persian
kings, and Abu Muslim never suspected that he should meet
with his death there, as he fancied that it was Asia Minor
which was meant by the oracle.</p>

<p>On entering into Al Mansur's presence, he met with a most
favorable reception, and was then told to retire to his tent;
but the Caliph only waited a favorable opportunity to take
him unawares. Abu Muslim then rode a number of times
to visit Al Mansur, whose manner appeared less cordial than
before. At last he went to the palace one day, and, being
informed that the Caliph was making his ablutions previously
to his prayers, sat down in an antechamber. In the
meanwhile Al Mansur had posted some persons behind a
curtain near to the sofa where Abu Muslim was sitting, with
the orders not to appear till the Caliph clapped his hands.
On this signal they were to strike off Abu Muslim's head.</p>

<p>Al Mansur then took his seat on the throne, and Abu
Muslim, being introduced, made his salutation, which the
Caliph returned. Al Mansur then permitted him to sit,
and, having commenced the conversation, proceeded to level
sundry reproaches against him. "Thou hast done this,"
said he, "and thou hast done that." "Why does my lord
speak so to me," replied Abu Muslim, "after all my efforts
and services?" "Son of a prostitute!" exclaimed Al Mansur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
"thou owest thy success to our own good fortune. Had
a negress slave been in thy place, she would have done as
much as thou! Was it not thou who soughtest to obtain in
marriage my aunt, Aasiya, pretending indeed that thou wast
a descendant of Salit, the son of Abd Allah Ibn Abbas?
Thou hast undertaken, infamous wretch! to mount where
thou canst not reach."</p>

<p>On this Abu Muslim seized him by the hand, which he
kissed and pressed, offering excuses for his conduct; but Al
Mansur shouted: "May God not spare me if I spare thee!"
He then clapped his hands, on which the assassins rushed
out upon Abu Muslim and cut him to pieces with their
swords, Al Mansur exclaiming all the time: "God cut your
hands off, rascals! Strike!" On receiving the first blow
Abu Muslim said: "Commander of the Faithful, spare me
that I may be useful against thy enemies." The Caliph replied:
"May God never spare me if I do! Where have I
a greater enemy than thee?"</p>

<p>When Abu Muslim was slain, his body was rolled up in a
carpet, and soon after Al Mansur's general, Jafar Ibn Hanzala,
entered. "What think you of Abu Muslim?" the
Caliph said to him. "Commander of the Faithful," answered
the other, "if you have ever the misfortune to pull a
single hair out of his head, there is no resource for you but
to kill him, and to kill him, and to kill him again." "God
has given thee understanding," replied Al Mansur: "here
he is in the carpet." On seeing him dead, Hanzala said:
"Commander of the Faithful, count this as the first day of
your reign." Al Mansur then recited this verse: "He threw
away his staff of travel, and found repose after a long
journey." After this he turned toward the persons present,
and recited these lines over the prostrate body:</p>

<p>"Thou didst pretend that our debt to thee could never be
paid! Receive now thy account in full, O Abu Mujrim.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Drink of that draught which thou didst so often serve to
others a draught more bitter to the throat than gall."</p>

</div>

<p class="heading"><i>Al Mansur and Ibn al Mukaffa</i></p>

<p>Ibn al Mukaffa, the translator of the book "Kalilah and
Dimnah" from Pehlevi into Arabic, was one of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
learned men during the reign of Al Mansur, but suspected
of Zendikism, or free-thinking. Al Mansur is reported to
have said: "I never found a book on Zendikism which did
not owe its origin to Ibn al Mukaffa." The latter used to
be a thorn in the side of Sofyan, the governor of Basra. As
Sofyan had a large nose, Ibn al Mukaffa used to say to him
when he visited him: "How are you both?" meaning him
and his nose. Sofyan once said: "I had never reason to
repent keeping silence." And Ibn al Mukaffa replied:
"Dumbness becomes you; why should you repent of it?"</p>

<p>These gibes rankled in Sofyan's mind, and ere long he had
an opportunity of glutting his vengeance on Ibn al Mukaffa.</p>

<p>Abdallah, the uncle of Al Mansur, had revolted against his
nephew, and aspired to the Caliphate; but being defeated
by Abu Muslim, who had been sent against him at the head
of an army, he took to flight, and dreading the vengeance of
Al Mansur, lay concealed at the house of his brothers, Sulaiman
and Isa. These two then interceded for him with the
Caliph, who consented to forgive what had passed; and it
was decided that a letter of pardon should be granted by
Al Mansur.</p>

<p>On coming to Basra the two brothers told Ibn al Mukaffa,
who was secretary to Isa, to draw up the letter of pardon,
and to word it in the strongest terms, so as to leave no pretext
to Al Mansur for making an attempt against Abdallah's
life. Ibn al Mukaffa obeyed their directions, and drew up
the letter in the most binding terms, inserting in it, among
others, the following clause: "And if at any time the Commander
of the Faithful act perfidiously toward his uncle,
Abdallah Ibn Ali, his wives shall be divorced from him, his
horses shall be confiscated for the service of God in war, his
slaves shall become free, and the Moslems loosed from their
allegiance to him." The other conditions of the deed were
expressed in a manner equally strict. Al Mansur, having
read the paper, was highly displeased, and asked who wrote
it. On being informed that it was Ibn al Mukaffa, his
brother's secretary, he sent a letter to Sofyan, the governor
of Basra, ordering him to put Ibn al Mukaffa to death. Sof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>yan
was already filled with rancor against Ibn al Mukaffa,
for the reasons mentioned above. He summoned him, and,
when he appeared, reminded him of his gibes. "Emir!"
exclaimed Ibn al Mukaffa, "I implore you in the name of
God to spare my life." "May my mother be disgraced,"
replied Sofyan, "if I do not kill thee in a manner such as
none was ever killed in before." On this he ordered an
oven to be heated, and the limbs of Ibn al Mukaffa to be cut
off, joint by joint; these he cast into the oven before his
eyes, and he then threw him in bodily, and closed the oven
on him, saying; "It is not a crime in me to punish you thus,
for you are a Zindik (free-thinker) who corrupted the
people."</p>

<p>Sulaiman and Isa, having made inquiries about their secretary,
were informed that he had gone into the palace of
Sofyan in good health and that he had not come out. They
therefore cited Sofyan before Al Mansur, and brought him
with them in chains. Witnesses were produced, who declared
that they saw Ibn al Mukaffa enter Sofyan's palace, and that
he never came out after, and Al Mansur promised to examine
into the matter. He then said to them: "Suppose that I
put Sofyan to death in retaliation for the death of Ibn al
Mukaffa, and that Ibn al Mukaffa himself then came forth
from that door" (pointing to one which was behind him)
"and spoke to you—what should I do to you in that case?
I should put you to death in retaliation for the death of
Sofyan." On this the witnesses retraced their evidence, and
Isa and Sulaiman ceased to speak of their secretary, knowing
that he had been killed by order of Al Mansur, who, disregarding
his promise, cast Abdallah Ibn Ali into prison.</p>

<p>Terrible as was the wrath of Al Mansur when roused,
there were not wanting on occasion those among his subjects
who had the courage to rebuke him. Once the Caliph was
addressing an audience at Damascus, and said: "O ye people!
it is incumbent on you to give praise to the Most High
that he has sent me to reign over you. For verily since I
began to reign over you, he has taken away the plague which
had come amongst you." But a certain Arab cried out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
him: "Of a truth Allah is too merciful to give us both thee
and the plague at one time!" On another occasion the theologian
Malik Ibn Anas relates the following: "One day the
Caliph Mansur sent for me and my friend Ibn Taous, against
whom he was known to entertain a grudge. When we entered
the presence-chamber, we beheld the executioner with his
sword drawn and the leather carpet spread, on which it was
customary to behead criminals. The Caliph signed to us
to seat ourselves, and when we had done so he remained a
long time with his head bent in meditation. He then raised
it, and turning to Ibn Taous, said: 'Recite me a saying
of the Prophet, on whom be peace.'</p>

<p>"Ibn Taous replied: 'The Prophet of God has said, "The
worst punished criminals in the day of judgment will be
those to whom God has entrusted authority and who have
abused it."' The Caliph was silent, and there was a pause.
I trembled, and drew my garments close round me, lest any
of the blood of Ibn Taous, whom I expected to see instantly
executed, should spurt upon them.</p>

<p>"Then the Caliph said to Ibn Taous: 'Hand me that ink-pot.'
But he never stirred. 'Why don't you hand it?'
asked the Caliph. 'Because,' he said, 'I fear you may
write some wrong order, and I do not wish to share the responsibility.'
'Get up and go,' the Caliph growled. 'Precisely
what we were desiring,' answered Ibn Taous, of whose
courage and coolness I from that day formed a high opinion."</p>

<p>Another bold rebuker of Al Mansur was the saint and
mystic, Amr Ibn Obaid, of whom it was said that he had
been "educated by the angels and brought up by the prophets."
Before Al Mansur's elevation to the Caliphate,
Amr Ibn Obaid had been his companion and intimate friend.
When Mansur came to the throne Amr went one day into
his presence, and was told by him to draw near and sit down.
The Caliph then asked to hear an exhortation from him.
Amr addressed him an admonition, in which he said, among
other things:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> "The power which thou now wieldest, had it
remained in the hands of thy predecessors, would never have
come to thee. Be warned, then, of that night which shall
give birth to a day never more to be followed by another
night." When Amr rose to depart, Al Mansur said: "We
have ordered ten thousand pieces of silver to be given thee."
"I stand not in need thereof," replied Amr. "By Allah,
thou shalt take it!" exclaimed the Caliph. "By Allah, I
shall not take it!" answered the other.</p>

<p>On this Al Mansur's son, Al Mahdi, who happened to be
present, said to Amr: "The Commander of the Faithful
swears that a thing shall be done, and yet thou art bold
enough to swear that it shall not." "Who is this youth?"
said Amr, turning to Al Mansur. "He is the declared successor
to the Caliphate, my son, Al Mahdi," replied Mansur.
"Thou hast clothed him in raiment," said Amr,
"which is not the raiment of the righteous, and thou hast
given him a name<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> which he deserveth not, and thou hast
smoothed for him a path wherein the more profit the less
heed."</p>

<p>Al Mansur then asked him if there was anything he
wished, and Amr made answer: "Send not for me, but wait
till I come to thee." "In that case," said Mansur, "thou
wilt never meet me." "That," replied Amr, "is precisely
what I desire." He then withdrew, and Al Mansur looked
after him and said: "All of you walk with stealthy steps;
all of you are in pursuit of prey—all except Amr Ibn
Obaid!"</p>


<p class="heading"><i>How Al Mansur Was Tricked</i></p>

<p>It has before been mentioned that Al Mansur, disregarding
the promise of pardon he had made to his uncle, Abdallah
Ibn Ali, who had revolted against him, cast him into
prison, where he remained a long time. When the Caliph
set out on the pilgrimage to Mecca, he committed Abdallah
to the care of Isa Ibn Musa, with private orders to put him
to death. Isa, not wishing to kill Abdallah, contented himself
with concealing him, sending a message to the Caliph to
say that he had been put to death. This rumor spread about,
and the Alides, the partisans of Abdallah, petitioned Al<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Mansur on the subject. The Caliph declared that he had
been committed to the care of Isa. The Alides then went to
Isa, and hearing from him that Abdallah had been put to
death, came again with complaints to Al Mansur. The
latter feigned to be in a rage, and exclaimed: "Since Isa has
killed my uncle without my authorizing him to do so, he
shall perish in his turn." The Caliph secretly desired that
Isa should have perpetrated this murder, so that he might
have a reasonable pretext for killing him, and thus ridding
himself of two enemies at once.</p>

<p>He accordingly sent for Isa, and said, "Is it true that
you have killed my uncle?" "Yes," replied Isa; "you
yourself ordered me to do so." "I never gave such an
order!" cried the Caliph. "My lord, here is the letter you
sent me." "I never wrote it," said Mansur. Isa, seeing
the mood the Caliph was in, and fearing for his own life,
confessed at last that the prisoner had been spared, and was
in safe-keeping. The Caliph then ordered him to hand
Abdallah over to the keeping of Abou 'l Azhar, which was
accordingly done, and Abdallah remained in prison till his
death was decided on.</p>

<p>When Abou 'l Azhar came to execute the sentence, he
found Abdallah with one of his female slaves. He strangled
him first, but when he was proceeding to strangle the slave
also, she cried out: "Servant of God, I pray thee for another
kind of death." "It was the only time," Abou 'l Azhar
said, "that I felt pity in carrying out a death-sentence. I
turned away my eyes while I gave the order to kill her. She
was strangled and placed by the side of her master. I then
had the house demolished, and they remained buried in the
ruins."</p>

<p>Al Mansur visited Medina, and said to his chamberlain,
Ar-Rabi, on entering the city: "Find me some learned and
intelligent person who can point out to me the chief mansions
of the place: it is now so long since I saw the dwellings
of my family." An intelligent youth was discovered by
Ar-Rabi, and presented to the Caliph. During their excursion
the guide did not make any observations unless asked by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Al Mansur to do so, but he then proceeded with great precision
and eloquence to furnish every requisite information.</p>

<p>Al Mansur was so highly pleased with him that he ordered
him a considerable sum of money, but the payment was delayed
so long that the youth found himself under the necessity
of asking for it. On being asked again to accompany Al
Mansur, he fulfilled his object in the following ingenious
manner: As they passed by the house which belonged to
Aatika, the granddaughter of Abu Sofyan, the young man
said, "This, O Commander of the Faithful, is the house of
that Aatika to whom Ibn Muhammad al Ansari alluded in
these lines:</p>

<p>"'Dwelling of Aatika! mansion which I avoid through
dread of foes! although my heart be fixed on thee, I turn away
and fly thee; but yet unconsciously I turn toward thee
again.'"</p>

<p>These words caused Al Mansur to reflect; and he said to
himself that the youth here must have some reason for giving
information, contrary to his habit, without being asked for it.
He therefore turned over the leaves of the poem from which
the verses were taken, passage by passage, till he came to the
following line:</p>

<p>"We see that you do what you promise, but there are
persons with deceitful tongues who promise but never perform."</p>

<p>He immediately asked his chamberlain if he had given
the youth what had been awarded him, and was informed
by him that a particular circumstance, which he mentioned,
had caused delay in the payment. The Caliph then ordered
Ar-Rabi to give him immediately the double of what had been
promised. The youth had most ingeniously hinted the circumstance,
and Al Mansur showed great penetration in perceiving
it.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Death of Al Mansur</i></p>

<p>Al Mansur was in the habit of saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> "I was born in
the month of Z'ul hajja, circumcised in it, attained the
Caliphate in it, and I think I shall die in the same month."
And so it befell. Fadl, son of Rabi, relates the following:
"I accompanied Al Mansur in the journey during which he
died. When we had arrived at one of the stages of the march
he sent for me. I found him seated in his pavilion, with
his face turned toward the wall. He said to me: 'Have I
not told you to prevent people coming into this room and
writing doleful sentences upon the wall?' 'What do you
mean, Prince?' I asked. 'Don't you see what is written
on the wall?'</p>

<p>"' "Abu Jafar,<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> thou art about to die; thy years are
fulfilled: the will of God must be done.</p>

<p>"' "Abu Jafar, can any astrologer bind the decrees of God,
or art thou entirely blind?"</p>

<p>"'Truly, Prince,' I replied, 'I can see no inscription
on this wall: its surface is smooth and quite white.' 'Swear
it, by God!' he said. I did so. 'It is, then,' he replied,
'a warning given me to prepare for my approaching demise.
Let us hasten to reach the sacred territory, that I may place
myself under the protection of God, and ask pardon for that
wherein I have exceeded.'</p>

<p>"We continued our journey, during which the Caliph suffered
great pain. When we arrived at the well of Maimun,
I told him the name of the place, and that we had reached the
sacred territory. He said, 'God be praised!' and died the
same day."</p>


<h5>THE CALIPHATE OF AL MAHDI</h5>

<p>Al Mahdi, the third Caliph of the Abbasside dynasty,
succeeded his father, Abu Jafar al Mansur, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 774. He
was as prodigal as his father was avaricious, and rapidly
squandered his vast inheritance. Al Mansur had appointed
as his instructor, before he succeeded to the throne, Sharki
Ibn Kotami, who was learned in all the lore and traditions of
the Arabs. One evening Al Mahdi asked his preceptor to divert
him with some amusing anecdote. "I obey, Prince.
May God protect you," answered Sharki. "They relate
that a certain King of Hirah had two courtiers whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
loved equally with himself. They never quitted his society
night or day, in the palace or on a journey. He took no decision
without consulting them, and his wishes coincided
with theirs. Thus they lived together a long time; but one
evening the King, having drunk to excess, drew his sword
from the sheath, and, rushing upon his two friends, killed
them; then he fell into a drunken slumber.</p>

<p>"The next morning, when told of what he had done, he
cast himself upon the earth, biting it in his fury, weeping for
his friends, and bewailing the loss of them. He fasted for
some days, and swore that for the rest of his life he would
abstain from the beverage which had deprived him of reason.
Then he had them buried, and erected a shrine over their
remains, to which he gave the title, 'El-Ghareiain' (The
Two Effigies). He commanded, in addition, that no persons
should pass this monument without prostrating themselves.</p>

<p>"Now, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, every custom
set up by a King of Hirah could not be changed, but became
a hard-and-fast tradition, handed on from generation
to generation. The command, therefore, of the King was
rigidly obeyed: his subjects, of low and high degree, never
passed before the double tomb without prostrating themselves.
This usage gradually acquired the binding force of
a religious rite. The King had ordered that any one who
refused to conform to it should be punished with death after
expressing two wishes, which would be granted, no matter
what they were.</p>

<p>"One day a fuller passed, bearing on his back a bundle
of clothes and a mallet. The guardians of the mausoleum
ordered him to kneel down. He refused. They threatened
him with death. He persisted in his refusal. They
brought him before the King, whom they informed of the
matter. 'Why did you refuse to bow down?' asked the
King. 'I did bow down,' answered the man; 'they are
lying.' 'No; you are the liar!' said the King. 'Express
two wishes; they shall be granted, and then you will die.'
'Nothing, then, can save me from death after those men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
have accused me?' asked the fuller. 'Nothing.' 'Very
well,' replied the fuller, 'here is my wish: I wish to strike
the King on the head with this mallet.' 'Fool!' answered
the King. 'It were better worth your while to let me enrich
those whom you leave behind you.' 'No,' said the
fuller; 'I only wish to strike the King on the back of his
head.'</p>

<p>"The King then addressed his ministers: 'What do you
think,' he said to them, 'of the wish of this madman?'
'Your Majesty,' they answered, 'you yourself have instituted
this law: your Majesty knows better than any one
that the violation of law is a shame, a calamity, a crime
which involves damnation. Besides, after having violated
one law, you will violate a second, then a third; your successors
will do the same, and all our laws will be profaned.'
The King replied: 'Get this man to ask anything he likes;
provided he lets me off, I am ready to grant all his requests,
even to the half of my kingdom.'</p>

<p>"They laid these proposals before the fuller, but in vain;
he declared that he had no other wish but to strike the King.
The latter, seeing that the man was thoroughly resolved, convoked
a public assembly. The fuller was introduced. He
took his mallet and struck the King on the back of the head
so violent a blow that he fell from his throne and lay stretched
on the ground unconscious. Subsequently he lay ill with
fever for six months, and was so severely injured that he
could only drink a drop at a time. At last he got well, recovered
the use of his tongue and could eat and drink. He
asked for news of the fuller. On being told that he was in
prison, he summoned him and said: 'There is still a wish
remaining to you: express it, so that I may order your death
according to law.'</p>

<p>"'Since it is absolutely necessary that I must die,' replied
the fuller, 'I wish to strike you another blow on the
head.' At these words the King was seized with dismay and
exclaimed that it was all over with him. At last he said to
the fuller:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> 'Wretch! renounce a claim which is profitless
to you. What advantage have you reaped from your first
wish? Ask for something else, and whatever it is, I will
grant it.' 'No, said the man, 'I only demand my right—the
right to strike you once more.'</p>

<p>"The King again consulted his ministers, who answered
that the best thing for him was to resign himself to death,
in obedience to the law. 'But,' said the King, 'if he strikes
me again, I shall never be able to drink any more; I know
what I have already suffered.' 'We can not help that, your
Majesty,' answered the ministers.</p>

<p>"Finding himself in this extremity, the King said to the
fuller: 'Answer, fellow! that day when you were brought
hither by the guardians of the mausoleum, did not I hear
you declare that you had prostrated yourself and that they
had slandered you?' 'Yes, I did say so,' answered the
fuller, 'but you would not believe me.' The King jumped
from his seat, embraced the fuller, and exclaimed: 'I swear
that you are more truthful than these rascals, and that they
have lied at your expense. I give you their place, and
authorize you to inflict upon them the punishment they have
deserved.'"</p>

<p>Al Mahdi laughed heartily on hearing this story, complimented
the narrator, and rewarded him generously.</p>

<p>The following anecdotes are related by Faika, the daughter
of Abd Allah: "We were one day with the Caliph Al
Mahdi, who had just returned from Anbar, to which he had
made a pleasure excursion, when Ar-Kabi, the chamberlain,
came in, holding a piece of leather on which some words were
written in charcoal, and to which was attached a seal composed
of clay mixed with ashes and bearing the impression
of the Caliph's signet-ring. 'Commander of the Faithful,'
said Ar-Kabi, 'I never saw anything more extraordinary
than this document; I received it from an Arab of the desert
who was crying out: "This is the Commander of the Faithful's
letter! Show me where to find the man who is called
Ar-Rabi, for it is to him that he told me to deliver it!"'</p>

<p>"Al Mahdi took the letter and laughed; he then
said: 'It is true: this is my writing and this is my seal.
Shall I relate how it happened?' To this we replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
'If it please the Commander of the Faithful.' Then he
said: 'I went out to hunt yesterday evening when the
shower was over. The next morning a thick mist overwhelmed
us, and I lost sight of my companions; I then suffered
such cold, hunger, and thirst as God only knows,
and I lost my way besides. At that moment came to
my mind a form of prayer which my father, Al Mansur,
had taught me, saying that his father, Muhammad, had
learned it from his grandfather, Ali, who had been taught it
by his father, Abd Allah, the son of Abbas. It was this:
"In the name of God," and "By the might of God! We
have no power or force but in God! I fly to God for protection!
I confide in God: God sufficeth me! He protected,
sufficeth, directeth, and healeth, from fire and flood,
from the fall of house, and from evil death!"</p>

<p>"'When I had uttered these words, God raised up a light
before me, and I went toward it, and lo! I found this very
Arab of the desert in his tent, with a fire which he had been
just lighting up. "Arab of the desert," said I, "hast thou
withal to treat a guest?" "Dismount!" said he. Then I
dismounted, and he said to his wife: "Bring here that
barley"; and she brought it. "Grind it," said he; and she
began to grind it. I then said to him: "Give me a drink
of water"; and he brought me a skin in which was a little
milk mixed with water, and I drank thereof a drink such as
I had never drunk before, it was so sweet! and he gave me
one of his saddle-cloths, and I laid my head on it, and never
did I sleep a sounder sleep.</p>

<p>"'On awaking, I saw him seize on a poor miserable sheep
and kill it, when his wife said to him: "Beware, wretched
man! thou hast slain thyself and thy children; our nourishment
came from this sheep, and yet thou hast killed it!
What then have we to live upon?" On this I said: "Do
not mind. Bring the sheep here"; and I opened it with the
knife I wore in my boot, and I took out the liver, and having
split it open, I placed it upon the fire and I ate thereof. I
then said to him: "Dost thou want anything? I shall
give thee a written order for it." On this he brought me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
that piece of leather, and I wrote on it with a bit of burnt
wood which I picked up at his feet that very note. I
then set this seal on it, and told him to go and ask for one
Ar-Rabi, to whom he was to give it.' This note contained
an order for five hundred thousand dirhems, and Al Mahdi
exclaimed on hearing it: 'By Allah! I meant only fifty
thousand, but since five hundred thousand are written in it,
I shall not diminish the sum one single dirhem; and were
there no more in the treasury, he should have it. So give
him beasts of burden, and let him take it away.'</p>

<p>"In a very short time that Arab had numerous flocks of
camels and sheep, and his dwelling became a halting-place for
those who were going on the pilgrimage, and it received the
name of the 'Dwelling of the host of Al Mahdi, the Commander
of the Faithful.'"</p>

<p>On another occasion it is recorded that Al Mahdi went
out hunting, and his horse ran away with him until he came
to the hut of an Arab. And the Caliph cried: "O Arab!
hast thou wherewith to feed a guest? "The Arab replied,
"Yes," and produced for him a barley loaf, which Al Mahdi
ate; then he brought some wine in a bottle, and gave him to
drink. And when Al Mahdi had drunk it, he said "O
brother of the Arabs, dost thou know who I am?" "No, by
Allah," he replied. "I am one of the personal attendants
of the Commander of the Faithful," said Al Mahdi. "May
Allah prosper thee in thy situation!" returned the Arab.
Then he poured out a second glass, and when Al Mahdi
had drunk it, he cried: "O Arab, dost thou know who I
am?"</p>

<p>He answered: "Thou hast stated that thou art one of the
personal attendants of the Commander of the Faithful."
"No," said Al Mahdi, "but I am one of the chief officers of
the Commander of the Faithful." "May thy country be
enlarged and thy wishes fulfilled!" exclaimed the Arab.
Then he poured out a third glass for him, and when Al
Mahdi had drained it, he said: "O Arab! dost thou know
who I am? "The man replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> "Thou hast made me believe
thou art one of the chief officers of the Commander
of the Faithful." "Not so," said Al Mahdi, "but I am the
Commander of the Faithful himself."</p>

<p>Then the Arab took the bottle and put it away and said:
"By Allah! wert thou to drink the fourth, thou wouldst declare
thyself to be Mohammed the Prophet of God!"</p>

<p>Then Al Mahdi laughed till he could laugh no more. And
lo! the horsemen surrounded them, and the Princes and
nobles dismounted before him, and the heart of the Arab stood
still. But Al Mahdi said to him: "Fear not! thou hast
done no wrong." And he ordered a robe and a sum of money
to be given him.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Al Mahdi and His Vizier Yakub ibn Daud</i></p>

<p>When Al Mahdi's father, Al Mansur, died, he left in the
treasury nine hundred million and sixty thousand dirhems
($112,507,500), and Abu Obaid Allah, the first Vizier of
Al Mahdi, advised the Caliph to be moderate in his expenses
and to spare the public money. When Abu Obaid Allah was
deposed, his successor, Yakub ibn Daud, flattered the inclinations
of the Caliph, and encouraged him to spend money,
enjoy all sorts of pleasures, drink wine, and listen to music.
By this means he succeeded in obtaining the entire administration
of the State. One of the poets of the time composed
an ode containing the following lines:</p>

<p>"Family of Abbas! your Caliphate is ruined! If you
seek for the Vicar of God, you will find him with a wine-flask
on one side and a lute on the other."</p>

<p>Abu Haritha, the guardian of the treasure-chambers, seeing
that they had become empty, waited on Al Mahdi with
the keys, and said: "Since you have spent all your treasures,
what is the use of my keeping these keys? Give orders
that they be taken from me." Al Mahdi replied:
"Keep them still, for money will be coming in to you." He
then dispatched messengers to all quarters in order to press
the payment of the revenues, and in a very short time
these sums arrived. They were so abundant that Abu
Haritha had enough to do in receiving them and verifying the
amount. During three days he did not appear before Al<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Mahdi, who at length said: "What is he about, that silly
Bedouin Arab?" Being informed of the cause which kept
him away, he sent for him and said: "What prevented your
coming to see us?" "The arrival of cash," replied the
other. "How foolish it was in you," said Al Mahdi, "to
suppose that money would not come in to us!" "Commander
of the Faithful," replied Abu Haritha, "if some
unforeseen event happened which could not be surmounted
without the aid of money, we should not have time to wait till
you sent to have the cash brought in."</p>

<p>It is related that Al Mahdi made the pilgrimage one year,
and passed by a milestone on which he saw something written.
He stopped to see what it was, and read the following line:</p>

<p>"O Mahdi! you would be truly excellent if you had not
taken for a favorite Yakub, the son of Daud."</p>

<p>He then said to a person who was with him: "Write
underneath that: 'It shall still be so, in spite of the fellow
who wrote that—bad luck attend him!' "On his return
from the pilgrimage, he stopped at the same milestone, because
the verse had probably made an impression on his mind;
and such, in fact, appears to have been the case, for very
soon after he let his vengeance fall on Yakub. Rumors unfavorable
to this minister had greatly multiplied. His enemies
had discovered a point by which he might be attacked,
and they reminded the Caliph of his having seconded Ibn
Abd Allah the Alide<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> in the revolt against Al Mansur.</p>

<p>One of Yakub's servants informed Al Mahdi that he had
heard his master say: "The Caliph has built a pleasure-house,
and spent on it fifty millions of dirhems ($6,250,000)
out of the public money." The fact was that Al Mahdi
had just founded the town of Isabad.</p>

<p>Another time Al Mahdi was about to execute some project
when Yakub said to him: "Commander of the Faithful,
that is mere profusion." To this Al Mahdi answered:
"Evil betide you! does not profusion befit persons of a noble
race?"</p>

<p>At last Yakub got so tired of the post which he filled that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
he requested of Al Mahdi permission to give it up, but that
favor he could not obtain. Al Mahdi then wished to try if
he was still inclined toward the party of the Alides, and sent
for him, after taking his seat in a salon of which all the furniture
was red. He himself had on red clothes, and behind
him stood a young female slave dressed in red; before him was
a garden filled with roses of all sorts. "Tell me, Yakub,"
said he, "what do you think of this salon of ours?" The
other replied: "It is the very perfection of beauty. May
God permit the Commander of the Faithful to enjoy it
long!" "Well," said Al Mahdi, "all that it contains is
yours, with this girl to crown your happiness, and, moreover,
a sum of one hundred thousand dirhems" ($12,500). Yakub
invoked God's blessing on the Caliph, who then said to him:
"I have something to ask of you." On this, Yakub stood up
from his seat, and exclaimed: "Commander of the Faithful,
such words can only proceed from anger. May God protect
me from your wrath." Al Mahdi replied: "I wish
you to promise to do what I ask." Yakub answered: "I
hear, and shall obey." "Swear by Allah," said the Caliph.
He swore. "Swear again by Allah." He swore. "Swear
again by Allah." He swore for the third time, and the
Caliph then said to him: "Lay your hand on my head and
swear again." Yakub did so.</p>

<p>Al Mahdi, having thus obtained from him the firmest
promise that could be made, said: "There is an Alide, and
I wish you to deliver me from the uneasiness which he
causes me, and thus set my mind at rest. Here he is; I give
him up to you." He then delivered the Alide over to him,
and bestowed on him the girl, with all the furniture that was
in the salon and the money. When the Alide was alone with
him, he said: "Yakub, beware lest you have my blood to answer
for before God. I am descended from Fatima, the
daughter of Mohammed, on whom God's blessings and favors
always repose." To this Yakub replied: "Tell me,
sir, if there be good in you." The Alide answered: "If
you do good to me, I shall be grateful and pray for your happiness."
"Receive the money," said Yakub,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> "and take
whatever road you like." "Such a road," said the Alide,
naming it, "is the safest." "Depart with my good wishes,"
said Yakub.</p>

<p>The girl heard all this conversation, and told a servant of
hers to go and relate it to Al Mahdi, and to say in her name:
"Such is the conduct of one whom in giving me to him you
preferred to yourself; such is the return he makes you for
your kindness." Al Mahdi immediately had the road
watched, so that the Alide was taken prisoner. He then sent
for Yakub, and said to him: "What has become of that
man?" Yakub replied: "I have delivered you from the
uneasiness he gave you." "Is he dead?" "He is."
"Swear by Allah." "I swear by Allah." "Lay your hand
upon my head." Yakub did so, and swore by his head. Al
Mahdi then said to an attendant: "Boy, bring out to us
those who are in that room." The boy opened the door, and
there the Alide was seen with the very money which Yakub
had given him.</p>

<p>Yakub was so much astounded that he was unable to utter
a word. "Your life," said Al Mahdi, "is justly forfeited,
and it is in my power to shed your blood, but I will not.
Shut him up in the <i>matbak</i>."<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>He had him confined in that dungeon, and gave orders that
no one should ever speak to him or to any other about him.
Yakub remained there during the rest of Al Mahdi's reign
(over two years), and during the reign of Musa-al-Hadi, the
son of Al Mahdi, and during five years and seven months of
the reign of Haroun al Rashid.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Al Mahdi and the Poet Abu'l Atahiyah</i></p>

<p>Some historians relate that the poet Abu'l Atahiyah had
conceived a passion for Otbah, the slave of Khayzuran, the
chief wife of the Caliph. This young girl complained to her
mistress of the gossip to which this affair gave rise. One
day Al Mahdi found her seated near her mistress in tears.
He questioned her, and having discovered the cause of her
grief, sent for Abu'l Atahiyah. When the poet came and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
stood before him, Al Mahdi said to him: "You are the author
of this verse concerning Otbah: 'May God judge between
me and my mistress, since she shows me nothing but
disdain and reproach!'" He then continued: "What
kindness has Otbah ever shown you that you have the right to
complain of her disdainfulness?"</p>

<p>"Sire," answered Abu'l Atahiyah, "I am not the author of
that verse, but of these:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"'O my camel, carry me rapidly; be not beguiled by what thou deemest repose—</div>
  <div class="verse">Carry me to a Prince to whom God has given the gift of working miracles;</div>
  <div class="verse">A Prince who, when the wind rises, says, "O wind, hast thou partaken of my benefits?"</div>
  <div class="verse">Two crowns adorn his brow the crown of beauty and the diadem of humility.'"</div>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>Al Mahdi sat silent for some time, looking at the ground,
which he tapped with his staff; then he lifted his head and
continued: "You have also said:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"'What does my mistress think upon when she displays her charms and allurements?</div>
  <div class="verse">There is among the slaves of Princes a young girl who conceals beneath her veil Beauty itself.'</div>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>"How do you know what she conceals beneath her veil?"
the Caliph asked. Abu'l Atahiyah replied in the same flattering
style:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Royalty has come to do him obeisance, and trailing her robe majestically,</div>
  <div class="verse">She only is fit for him, as he for her."</div>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>But as the Caliph continued to ply him with questions
Abu'l Atahiyah became embarrassed in his answers, and was
condemned to expiate his temerity by a flogging. He had
just undergone his punishment when Otbah met him in this
piteous plight. The poet reproached her thus: "Praise be
to thee, Otbah! It is because of thee that the Caliph has
shed the blood of a man already dying of love." Tears
started to Otbah's eyes; she ran sobbing to her mistress,
Khayzuran, and there met the Caliph. He asked why she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
wept, and hearing she had seen the poet after his flagellation,
consoled her; then he caused a sum of fifty thousand dirhems
to be given to the former.</p>

<p>Abu'l Atahiyah distributed them to all those whom he
met in the palace. Al Mahdi, being informed of his generosity,
asked him why he had thus disposed of the money he
had just received from the Caliph. The poet answered: "I
did not wish to profit by what my love had won." Al Mahdi
sent him fifty thousand more dirhems, making him swear not
to employ them in fresh benefactions.</p>

<p>Another historian relates that Abu'l Atahiyah, on a certain
New Year's Day, presented Al Mahdi with a Chinese vase
containing perfumes. On the vase were engraved these
verses:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">"My soul is attached to one of the good things of
this world; the accomplishment of its desires depends on God and Al Mahdi,
his Vicar.</div>
 <div class="verse">I despair of obtaining my object, but thy contempt of
the world and all which it contains reanimates my hope."</div>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>The Caliph thought of giving him Otbah, when she said to
him. "Prince of the believers! would you, in spite of my
privileges, my rights, and my services, bestow me upon a
pottery merchant—a man who makes money out of his
poetry?" Al Mahdi then sent a message to the poet: "As
to Otbah, you will never obtain her, but I have ordered the
vase you sent to be filled with money."</p>

<p>Soon afterward Otbah, passing by, found the poet disputing
with the clerks of the treasury, and maintaining that
by "money" the Caliph meant gold dinars, while they alleged
that he only intended silver dirhems. "If you really
loved Otbah," she said to him, "you would not think of the
difference between gold and silver."</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Death of Al Mahdi</i></p>

<p>Tabari, the historian, describes the death of Al Mahdi
as taking place in the following tragic manner: Among his
wives there were two for whom he seems to have entertained
an equal degree of affection; but as one of them seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the other to have the preference in his heart, the latter, whose
name was Hassanna, conceived a bitter jealousy against her
rival, and determined to be avenged on her. In order to accomplish
her purpose, she prepared a dish of confectionery,
in which she mixed a malignant poison, and sent it as an offering
to her rival.</p>

<p>As the damsel who was dispatched upon the errand happened
to pass beneath one of the balconies of the palace, Al
Mahdi, who was watching the sunset, saw her. The confectionery,
which was uncovered, attracting his notice, he asked
the messenger whither she was bound. She having informed
him, he took and ate heartily of it, saying: "Hassanna will,
I am sure, be better pleased that I should partake of her
sweets than any one else." In a few hours he was a corpse.</p>


<h5>THE CALIPH HAROUN AL RASHID</h5>

<p>Haroun al Rashid became Caliph in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 786, and
he ranks among the Caliphs who have been most distinguished
by eloquence, learning, and generosity. During the whole
of his reign he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca or carried
on war with the unbelievers nearly every year. His daily
prayers exceeded the number fixed by the law,<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and he used
to perform the pilgrimage on foot, an act which no previous
Caliph had done. When he went on pilgrimage he took with
him a hundred learned men and their sons, and when he
did not perform it himself he sent three hundred substitutes,
whom he appareled richly, and whose expenses he defrayed
with generosity.</p>

<p>His conduct generally resembled that of the Caliph Mansur,
but he did not imitate the parsimony of the latter. He always
repaid services done to him, and that without much delay.
He was fond of poetry and poets, and patronized literary
and learned men. Religious controversies were hateful
to him. Eulogy he relished highly, especially eulogy by
gifted poets, whom he richly rewarded.</p>

<p>The historian Asmai relates the following anecdote: One
day the Caliph gave a feast in a magnificently decorated hall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
During the feast he sent for the poet Abu'l Atahiyah, and
commanded him to depict in verse the gorgeous scene.</p>

<p>The poet began: "Live, O Caliph, in the fulfilment of all
thy desire, in the shelter of thy lofty palace!"</p>

<p>"Very good!" exclaimed Rashid. "Let us hear the rest."</p>

<p>The poet continued: "Each morn and eve be all thy servitors
swift to execute thy behests!"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said the Caliph. "Go on!"</p>

<p>The poet replied: "But when the death-rattle chokes thy
breath thou wilt learn, alas! that all thy delights were a
shadow."</p>

<p>Rashid burst into tears. Fadhl, the son of Yahya
(Haroun's Vizier), seeing this, said to the poet: "The
Caliph sent for you to divert him, and you have plunged him
into melancholy." "Let him be," said Rashid; "he saw us
in a state of blindness, and tried to open our eyes."</p>

<p>This Prince treated learned men with great regard.
Abou Moawia, one of the most learned men of his time, related
that when he was sitting one day at food with the Caliph,
the latter poured water on his hands after the meal, and
said to him: "Abou Moawia, do you know who has just
washed your hands?" He answered: "No." Rashid informed
him that it was himself. Abou Moawia replied:
"Prince, you doubtless act in this manner in order to do
homage to learning." "You speak truth," answered Rashid.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Mouseli relates the following story: "Rashid
one day summoned all his musicians. I and Meskin of
Medina were among the performers. Rashid had partaken
freely of wine, and wished to hear performed an air which
had suddenly occurred to his mind. The officer stationed
before the curtain which concealed the Caliph told Ibn Jami
to sing this piece. The latter obeyed, but did not succeed
in pleasing the Caliph. Each of the singers present attempted
it, but were no more successful than Ibn Jami.
Then the officer, addressing Meskin, said: 'The Commander
of the Faithful orders you to sing this air if you can
do it properly.'</p>

<p>"Meskin commenced at once to sing, to the great surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of the audience, who could not understand how a musician
like him had the courage to attempt, before us, an air which
none of us had been able to render to the satisfaction of the
Caliph. As soon as he had finished I heard Rashid raise his
voice and ask to hear it a second time. Meskin recommenced
with a skill and spirit which won him everybody's applause.
The Caliph congratulated and praised him to the
skies; then he had the curtain behind which he had been sitting
drawn aside.</p>

<p>"'Prince of the believers,' then said Meskin to him, 'a
strange story attaches to this piece'; and at the invitation of
the Caliph he narrated it in these words: 'I was formerly a
slave of a member of the family of Zobeir, and carried on the
trade of a tailor. My master claimed from me a tax of two
dirhems daily, after paying which I was free to do what I
liked. I was passionately fond of singing. One day a descendant
of Ali, for whom I had just completed a tunic, paid
me two dirhems for it, kept me to eat with him, and made me
drink generously. As I left him I met a negress carrying her
pitcher on her shoulder, and singing the song you have just
heard. I was so delighted at it that, forgetting everything
else, I said to her: "By the Prophet, I adjure thee to teach
me that air." "By the Prophet," she answered, "I will not
teach it unless you pay me two dirhems."</p>

<p>"'Then, Prince of believers, I took out the two dirhems,
with which I had intended to pay my daily tax, and gave them
to the negress. She, setting her pitcher down, sat on the
ground and, keeping time with her fingers on the pitcher, sang
the piece, and repeated it till it was well impressed on my
memory.</p>

<p>"'I then proceeded to my master. As soon as he saw
me he demanded his two dirhems, and I related my adventure
to him. "Scoundrel!" he said. "Have I not warned you
that I will take no excuse, even if a farthing is missing?"
Saying this, he laid me on the ground and, with the utmost
vigor of his arm, gave me fifty strokes of a rod, and, as an
additional disgrace, caused my head and chin to be shaved.
Verily, O Prince, I passed a melancholy night. The severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
punishment I had undergone made me forget the piece I
had learned, and this was the saddest of all. In the morning,
wrapping my head in a cloak, I hid my large tailor's scissors
in my sleeve, and directed my steps to the spot where I had
met the negress. I waited there in perplexity, not knowing
her name nor her abode. All at once I saw her coming; the
sight of her dispersed all my cares. I approached her, and
she said to me: "By the Lord of the Kaaba, you have forgotten
the song!" "Yes, I have," I answered. I told her
how my head and chin had been shaved, and offered her a reward
if she would sing her song again. "By the Prophet,"
she answered, "I will not for less than two dirhems."</p>

<p>"'I took out my scissors and ran and pawned them for
two dirhems, which I gave her. She put down her pitcher,
and began to sing as she had done the evening before; but as
soon as she began, I said: "Give me back the two dirhems;
I don't need your song." "By Allah," she said, "you shall
not see them again; don't think it." Then she added: "I
am certain that the four dirhems you have spent will be worth
to you four thousand dinars from the hand of the Caliph."
Then she resumed her song, accompanying herself, as before,
on her pitcher, and did not cease repeating it till I had got it
by heart.</p>

<p>"'We separated. I returned to my master, but in a state
of great apprehension. When he saw me he demanded his
daily due, while I stammered out excuses. "Beast!" he
shouted, "was not yesterday's lesson enough for you?" "I
wish to speak to you frankly and without falsehood," I answered.
"Yesterday's and to-day's dirhems went in payment
for a song"; and I began to sing it to him. "What!"
he exclaimed, "you have known an air like that for two days
and told me nothing of it? May my wife be divorced if it
is not true that I would have let you go yesterday if you had
sung it to me! Your head and chin have been shaved—I
can not help that—but I let you off your tax till your hair
grows again."'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>
<p>"Hearing this recital, Rashid laughed heartily, and said
to the musician: 'I don't know which is better, your song or
your story; I will see in my turn that the forecast of the negress
is verified.' So Meskin went out from the Caliph's
presence richer by four thousand dinars."</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Barmecides, Viziers of Haroun al Rashid</i></p>

<p>On attaining the Caliphate, Rashid conferred the Viziership
on Yahya, son of Khaled, son of Barmek. Yahya had
served him as secretary before his accession to the throne, and
this was the foundation of the magnificence of the family of
the Barmecides, whose commencement and whose tragic fall
we are about to narrate.</p>

<p>The family of the Barmecides had originally been Zoroastrians
in religion, but from the time of their embracing Islam
they continued to be good Mussulmen. They were the crown
and ornament of their age. Their generosity passed into a
proverb; adherents thronged to their court from every side,
and multitudes centered their hopes on them. Fortune showered
upon them a prodigality of favors. Yahya and his
sons were like brilliant stars, vast oceans, impetuous torrents,
beneficent showers. Every kind of talent and learning
was represented in their court, and men of worth received
a hearty welcome there. The world was revived under their
administration, and the empire reached its culminating point
of splendor. They were a refuge for the afflicted and a
haven for the distressed. The poet Abou-Nowas said of
them:</p>

<p>"Since the world has lost you, O sons of Barmek, we no
longer see the ways crowded with travelers at sunrise and
sunset."</p>

<p>We have an example of the generosity of the Barmecides
in the following story, related by Salih bin Muhran, one of
the intimate attendants of Haroun al Rashid:</p>

<p>"One day Haroun sent for me, and when I arrived in his
presence I saw that he was vexed and perplexed, and full of
thought, and very much enraged. When I stood still awhile
he lifted up his head, and said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> 'Go this moment to Mansur
Bin Ziyad, and before night thou must have from him
ten thousand thousand dirhems, and, if not, cut off his head
and bring it to me; and if thou fail in this, I swear by the
soul of Mahdi I will command thy head to be severed from
thy body.' I said: 'May the life of the Commander of the
Faithful be prolonged! If he gives a part to-day, and sends
somewhat more to-morrow on the condition that he gives me
a pledge for the payment of the whole-—-' He replied:
'No! If he does not give thee to-day ten thousand thousand
dirhems in coined money, bring me his head. What concern
hast thou in this matter?' When he said this I knew
he was aiming at the life of Mansur, and I went out from him
in great perplexity and distress, saying, 'O Lord, what has
come to me? It will be needful to slay Mansur, and he is one
of the most worthy and best-known men of Bagdad, and has
a numerous following.'</p>

<p>"At length I went to the house of Mansur, and, taking him
on one side, told him the whole story as it had happened, and
what my commands were. When he heard he wept aloud,
and fell at my feet, saying: 'In truth the Commander of the
Faithful seeks my life; for his courtiers and many others
know there is no such sum in my house. Nor could I in my
whole life bring together so much; how, then, can I do it in
one day? But do thou show me one favor, for God's sake-.
take me to my house, that I may bid farewell to my children
and followers and clansmen, and ask forgiveness of my offenses
from my companions and acquaintances.'</p>

<p>"I took him to his house, as he desired, and when his
family and chief friends heard what had happened there was
an outcry among them. They wept and bewailed so that
jinns and men, and wild beasts and birds, were sorrowful for
them, and my heart burned to see them. At last he brought
out what money and valuables he had, amounting to two million
dirhems, and gave it to me, saying: 'In days past, before
Haroun al Rashid was Caliph, I often vexed Yahya the
Barmecide, and during this present reign also he suffered
much annoyance and persecution from me. But on a certain
occasion he treated me with kindness, and put my hand in
his, and I knew that he had forgiven my fault, and that there
was no feeling of revenge remaining in his heart; and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>ward
he did me many kindnesses with the Caliph. If thou
wilt deal kindly with me—his house is at the head of the
way—take me there. It may be his heart will be touched
for me; for all the members of his house are men of liberality,
and they desire that even their enemy and ill-wisher may take
refuge with them, that they may help him in his distress and
misery.'</p>

<p>"I said: 'Thou speakest truly, and it will be a delight to
myself to take thee there. Come, let us go. By Allah the
Most High, it must needs be they will cause thee to rejoice.'
When we arrived at the house of Yahya, he had just finished
the afternoon prayer, and was repeating the <i>Tesbih</i>.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> When
he saw Mansur, and he had explained to him his distress and
misery, Yahya came up to me and inquired of me the state of
the case, which I revealed to him. He comforted Mansur,
and bade him keep up his heart; 'For,' said he, 'I will not
be wanting in doing all that is in my power to help thee.' At
the same time he called his treasurer, and said to him:
'Bring me all that is in the treasury.' The treasurer brought
all that he had of coined money and jewels, and the amount
was two hundred thousand dirhems.</p>

<p>"Then he wrote a letter to his eldest son, Fadhl, bidding
him send what money he had, for that an unfortunate man
was waiting for it. When Fadhl had read the note, he immediately
sent two hundred thousand dirhems. Then he
wrote a note to Jafar, his younger son, bidding him send
immediately all the money he had. He also sent three hundred
thousand dirhems. Then he said to me: 'Take this
money to the Commander of the Faithful, and represent to
him that I will send to-morrow three million dirhems more
into his treasury.' I replied: 'This is not in my orders.
To-day, by the hour of evening prayer, I must be in the presence
of the Caliph with the gold or the head.'</p>

<p>"When Yahya heard this he sent for his slave Otbah, and
bade her go to Fatima, the sister of the Commander of the
Faithful, and to explain the case to her. When Otbah had
told Fatima how the matter stood, that lady, who was a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
of much generosity, took off a collar set with jewels which
she had received from the Caliph, of which the value was
estimated at two hundred thousand dinars of gold, and sent it
to Yahya, asking besides a thousand pardons that she could
do no more.</p>

<p>"When at last the ten million of dirhems was raised,
Yahya delivered it all to porters, and sent it by me to the
Caliph. It was near the setting of the sun when I brought
the money to Haroun al Rashid. When he saw me, he cried:
'Hast thou brought Mansur?' I told him all that had
passed, whereupon he bade me send the money to the treasury
and go for Yahya. When I had placed the money in the
treasury, I went to Yahya and told him that the Caliph had
accepted the money, and wished to see him. He broke out
into exclamations of gladness when he heard this, and, calling
for Mansur, he said: 'Take courage, for thou art saved
from destruction. The Commander of the Faithful has just
asked for me, and I will so contrive as to render him again
favorably disposed toward thee.'</p>

<p>"Then Mansur's soul again returned to his body, and he
thanked Yahya fervently. When Yahya arrived in the presence
of the Caliph and saw his face averted, he was afraid;
for he thought: 'Perchance he will reprove me for my want
of respect in releasing Mansur.' So, after some time, he
prayed for pardon of his offense, and conciliated the Caliph.
Afterward he said: 'Wilt thou tell me what was the crime
of which Mansur was guilty?' The Caliph replied: 'His
crime was his enmity against you and his evil-speaking concerning
you. For this reason I have long wished to strike off
his head. To-day I was so incensed that I commanded either
that he should pay this money or that his head should be cut
off. But thou hast done as the generous always do.' Yahya
said: 'May the life of the Commander of the Faithful be
long! For if the Commander of the Faithful had said,
"The wealth of Yahya and his sons is of my gift, and this
necklace, too, of my sister's is a gift of mine. What has any
one to do in this matter? Go and cut off Mansur's head,"
what could he have done and what could I have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>?'</p>

<p>"This speech pleased Haroun al Rashid, but he blamed
Yahya because he had asked for his sister's necklace, and
sent it to the treasury to meet the demand on Mansur. He
also blamed his sister for giving away the necklace. She replied:
'It would have been shame if I had not answered the
request of one who was in the place of a father to me.' This
reply pleased the Caliph, and he restored to Fatima the
jeweled collar, and Yahya and Mansur were again glad at
heart."</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Fall of the Barmecides</i></p>

<p>Haroun al Rashid had such an extraordinary affection
to Jafar the Barmecide that he could not bear to be one hour
apart from him. Rashid loved his own sister Abbasah also
with an extreme affection, and could not bear to be long absent
from her. She was a woman of extraordinary beauty, and exceeded
all in science and knowledge. Zobeidah, who was the
chief favorite of the Caliph, and all her dependents were opposed
to Abbasah.</p>

<p>One day Rashid said to Jafar: "Thou knowest how great
is my affection to thee, and also how greatly I love my sister
Abbasah, and that I can not live without the company of
either of you. I have thought of an expedient whereby you
may both accompany me in the same assembly—that a marriage
take place between you. That will legalize your meeting
and authorize your beholding one another. But all this is
on condition that you never meet except I am a third in the
party."</p>

<p>When Jafar heard this, the world on all sides grew black
with darkness to his eyes. Distressed and confounded, he
fell at the feet of Rashid, and said: "Commander of the
Faithful, wilt thou slay me? From the time of Adam to our
day no servant has been admitted to such confidence as that
he should marry with the family of his lords and benefactors;
or if any one hath treacherously imagined such a thing, very
shortly he hath been reduced to nothingness, and all men have
counted him a bread-and-salt traitor. And what sin hath
thy slave committed, O Commander of the Faithful, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
thou shouldest seek after his blood? Is this the reward of all
my services and devotion? And, besides, how should I, the
son of a Persian <i>Guebre</i> (fire-worshiper), be allied to the
family of Hashem and the nephews of the Prophet—may
the mercy of God be upon him and his family!—and by
what right can I aspire to such a distinction? If my father
and mother heard of this, they would mourn for me, and my
enemies would rejoice."</p>

<p>Some days passed, and he neither ate nor drank, but all
was of no avail. He could not oppose the decrees of heaven
and the ordainment of God by remedy or contrivance. Unable
to help himself, he submitted and consented to a marriage
on the terms before mentioned. When Yahya, the father of
Jafar and Fadhl, and his other brothers heard of this, they
were full of sorrow, and looked for the reversal of their fortune
and the downfall of their power.</p>

<p>These forebodings were soon justified. The cruel commands
of Rashid to his favorite and his sister were disregarded,
and Abbasah became a mother. The birth of the
child, concealed for a time, was revealed to Rashid by a revengeful
slave-girl whom Abbasah had struck. The Caliph
was intensely wroth, but concealed his indignation for a time,
though betraying it at unguarded moments.</p>

<p>Ahmed Bin Muhammad Wasil, who was one of his confidential
attendants, relates as follows: "One day I was
standing before Rashid in his private apartment when no
one besides was there. Perfumes were burning, and the
place was filled with sweet odors. Haroun al Rashid lay
down to rest, and wrapped his head in the skirt of his garment
to keep his eyes cool, when Jafar the Barmecide came in and
told his business to the Caliph, receiving in return a gracious
answer, and retiring. In those days the story of Abbasah
and her union with Jafar was talked of currently among the
people.</p>

<p>"When Jafar was gone Rashid lifted his head out of his
skirt, and from his mouth came these words:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> 'O God, do
thou so favor Jafar the Barmecide that he may kill me, or
make me quickly powerful over him that I may cut off his
head from his body; for with anger and jealousy against him
I am near to destruction.' These words he spoke to himself,
but they reached my ears, and I trembled within and without,
and I said to myself: 'If the Commander of the Faithful
knows that I have heard this, he will not leave me alive.'</p>

<p>"Suddenly Haroun al Rashid lifted up his head from
its covering, and said to me: 'Hast thou heard that which I
said to myself just now?' I said: 'I have not heard it.'
The Commander of the Faithful said: 'There is no one
but thyself here, and so truly as the censer is in thy hand,
thou hast heard all. If thou care for thy life, keep this
secret concealed; and if not, I will strike off thy head.' I replied:
'May the life of the Commander of the Faithful be
long! I have not heard any of these words.' And with this
the Caliph was satisfied."</p>

<p>It was not long after this that the blow fell on the Barmecides.
On his return from one of his pilgrimages to
Mecca, Rashid came by water from Hira to Anbar, on the
River Euphrates. Here he invited the three brothers Fadhl,
Jafar, and Mousa, to his presence, and, having caressed them
with extraordinary cordiality, dismissed them once more to
their quarters, with rich <i>khelats</i>, the customary robe of honor.
The Caliph withdrew to his apartments, and betook himself
to his usual indulgence in wine. In a little time he sent one
of his domestics to inquire if Jafar was employed in the same
way. Finding that such was not the case, Rashid sent his
attendant again to Jafar, urging him by the life of his master
to imitate his example without further delay, for that his
wine seemed deprived of all its zest until he knew that his
faithful Jafar partook of the same enjoyment.</p>

<p>Jafar felt, however, unaccountably alarmed and averse to
such a gratification, and, reluctantly withdrawing to his chamber,
called for the wine. It happened that he was attended
by a favorite blind minstrel named Abou Zaccar, to whom,
after a few goblets, he could not forbear from communicating
his apprehensions. The minstrel treated them as merely
imaginary, urged his master to banish them from his
thoughts, and to resume his usual cheerfulness. But Jafar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
declared that he found it impossible to dispel the uneasiness
which seemed to haunt him. About the hour of evening
prayer another messenger arrived from Rashid with a present
of nuts and sweetmeats for Jafar, as a relish to his wine, from
his own table.</p>

<p>When midnight came, Rashid called for Mesrour, his favorite
domestic, and directed him to bring Jafar and strike off
his head. Mesrour proceeded accordingly, and entering Jafar's
apartment while Abou Zaccar was singing some Arabic
verses, stood suddenly at the head of Jafar, who started involuntarily
at his appearance. Mesrour told him that he was
summoned to attend the Caliph. Jafar entreated that he
might be permitted to withdraw for a moment, to speak to the
women of his family. This last indulgence was withheld,
Mesrour observing that any instructions which he had to communicate
might as well be delivered where he was. This he
was accordingly obliged to do, after which he accompanied
Mesrour to his tent, on entering which the latter immediately
drew his sword. Jafar asked that the Caliph's instructions
might be explained to him, and when he heard them, cautioned
Mesrour to beware how he carried into execution an
order which had evidently been given under the influence of
wine, lest, when their sovereign should be restored to himself,
it might be followed by unavailing repentance and remorse.
He further adjured Mesrour by the memory of their past
friendship that he would return to the Caliph's presence, and
require his final commands.</p>

<p>Mesrour yielded to these entreaties, and appeared before
Rashid, whom he found expecting his return. "Is this the
head of Jafar?" demanded the Caliph. "Jafar is at the
door, my lord," replied Mesrour, with some trepidation. "I
wanted not Jafar," said the Caliph sternly; "I wanted his
head." This sealed the fate of the unhappy favorite. Mesrour
immediately withdrew, decapitated Jafar in the antechamber,
and returned with his head, which he laid at the
Caliph's feet. He was then directed by Rashid to keep that
head by him till he should receive further orders.</p>

<p>In the meantime he was enjoined to proceed without delay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
and apprehend Yahya, his three sons, Fadhl, Muhammad,
and Mousa, and his brother Muhammad. These commands
were immediately carried into execution. The head of Jafar
was dispatched the next day, to be suspended to a gibbet on
the bridge of Bagdad, after which the Caliph continued his
journey to Rakkah.</p>

<p>Stripped of all their wealth and honors, Yahya, his three
sons, and his brother Muhammad, languished in confinement,
until the former perished in prison. At first they were allowed
some liberty, but subsequently they experienced alternatives
of rigor and relaxation, according to the reports which
reached Rashid concerning them. He then confiscated the
property of every member of the family. It is said that Mesrour
was sent by him to the prison, and that he told the jailor
to bring Fadhl before him. When he was brought out, Mesrour
addressed him thus: "The Commander of the Faithful
sends me to say that he ordered thee to make a true statement
of thy property, and that thou didst pretend to do so;
but he is assured that thou hast still great wealth in reserve,
and his orders to me are that, if thou dost not inform me
where the money is, I am to give thee two hundred strokes of
a whip. I should therefore advise thee not to prefer thy
riches to thyself."</p>

<p>On this Fadhl looked up at him and said: "By Allah, I
made no false statements; and were the choice offered to me
of being sent out of the world or of receiving a single stroke of
a whip, I should prefer the former alternative—<i>that</i> the
Commander of the Faithful well knoweth, and thou also knowest
full well that we maintained our reputation at the expense
of our wealth. How, then, could we now shield our wealth
at the expense of our bodies? If thou hast really got any orders,
let them be executed."</p>

<p>On this Mesrour produced some whips, which he brought
with him rolled up in a napkin, and ordered his servants to
inflict on Al Fadhl two hundred stripes. They struck him
with all their force, using no moderation in their blows, so that
they nearly killed him. There was in that place a man skilled
in treating wounds, who was called in to attend Al Fadhl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
When he saw him he observed that fifty strokes had been inflicted
on him; and when the others declared that two hundred
had been given, he asserted that his back bore the
traces of fifty, and not more. He then told Al Fadhl that he
must lie down on his back on a reed-mat, so that they might
tread on his breast. Al Fadhl shuddered at the proposal,
but, having at length given his consent, they placed him on
his back. The operator then trod on him, after which he
took him by the arms and dragged him along the mat, by
which means a great quantity of flesh was torn off the back.
He then proceeded to dress the wounds, and continued his
services regularly, till one day, when, on examining them, he
immediately prostrated himself in thanksgiving to God.
They asked him what was the matter, and he replied that the
patient was saved, because new flesh was forming. He then
said: "Did I not say that he had received fifty strokes?
Well, by Allah! one thousand strokes could not have left worse
marks; but I merely said so that he might take courage, and
thus aid my efforts to cure him."</p>

<p>Al Fadhl, on his recovery, borrowed ten thousand dirhems
from a friend, and sent them to the doctor, who returned
them. Thinking that he had offered too little, he borrowed
ten thousand more; but the man refused them, and said:
"I can not accept a fee for curing the greatest among the
generous. Were it even twenty thousand dinars, I should refuse
them." When this was told to Al Fadhl, he declared that
such an act of generosity surpassed all that he himself had
done during the whole course of his life.</p>

<p>When Rashid had overthrown the family of the Barmecides,
he endeavored to obliterate even their very name. He
forbade the poets to compose elegies on their fall, and commanded
that those who did so should be punished. One day
one of the soldiers of the guard, passing near some ruined and
abandoned buildings, perceived a man standing upright with
a paper in his hand. It contained a lament for the ruin of
the Barmecides, which he was reciting with tears.</p>

<p>The soldier arrested him, and conducted him to the palace
of Rashid. He related the whole matter to the Caliph, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
caused the accused to be brought before him. When he was
convinced by the man's own confession of the truth of the accusation,
he said to him: "Did you not know that I have
forbidden the utterance of any lament for the family of the
Barmecides? Assuredly I will treat thee according to thy
deserts." "Prince," the accused answered, "if thou wilt
allow, I will relate my history. Afterward deal with me as
thou pleasest."</p>

<p>Rashid having allowed him to speak, he went on: "I was
one of the petty officials in the court of Yahya. One day he
said to me: 'I must dine at your house.' 'My lord,' I said
to him, 'I am far too mean for such an honor, and my house
is not fit to receive you.' 'No,' replied Yahya, 'I must come
to you.' 'In that case,' I said, 'will you allow me some time
to make the proper arrangements and put my house in order?—and
afterward do as you like.'</p>

<p>"He then wished to know how much time I wanted. At
first I asked for a year. This appeared to him too much; I
therefore asked for some months. He consented, and I immediately
began to prepare everything necessary for his reception.
When all the preparations were complete I sent to
inform Yahya, who said he would come on the morrow. On
the next day, accordingly, he came, with his two sons Jafar
and Fadhl and a few of his most intimate friends. Scarcely
had he dismounted than he addressed me by name, and said:
'Make haste and get me something to eat, for I am hungry.'
Fadhl told me that his father was especially fond of roast
fowl; accordingly I brought some, and when Yahya had eaten
he rose and began to walk about the house, and asked me to
show him all over it. 'My lord,' I said, 'you have just been
over it: there is no more.' 'Certainly there is more,' he
replied.</p>

<p>"It was in vain that I assured him, in the name of God,
that that was all I had: he had a mason sent for, and told him
to make a hole in the wall. The mason began to do so. I
said to Yahya: 'My Lord, is it permissible to make a hole
into one's neighbor's house when God has commanded us to
respect our neighbors' rights?' 'Never mind,' said he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
And when the mason had made a sufficiently wide entrance,
he went through, with his sons.</p>

<p>"I followed them, and we came into a delicious garden,
well planted and watered by fountains. In this garden were
pavilions and halls adorned with all kinds of marbles and
tapestry; on all sides were numbers of beautiful slaves of both
sexes. Yahya then said to me: This house and all that you
see is yours.' I hastened to kiss his hands and to pray God
to bless him, and then I learned that from the very day he had
told me that he was coming to my house he had bought the
ground adjacent to it, and caused a beautiful mansion to be
constructed, furnished, and adorned, without my knowing
anything of it. I saw indeed that building was going on,
but I thought it was some work being carried on by one of
my neighbors.</p>

<p>"Yahya then, addressing his son Jafar, said to him:
'Well, here is a house, with attendants, but how is he to keep
it up?' 'I will make over to him such and such a farm, with
its revenues,' answered Jafar, 'and sign a contract with him
to that effect.' 'Very good,' said Yahya, turning to his other
son, Fadhl; 'but till he receives those revenues, how is he to
meet current expenses?' 'I will give him ten thousand
pieces of gold,' answered Fadhl, 'and have them conveyed to
his house.' 'Be quick, then,' said Yahya, 'and fulfil your
promises without delay.' This they both did, so that I found
myself rich of a sudden and living a life of ease. Thus,
O Commander of the Faithful, I have never failed on all fitting
occasions to rehearse their praises and to pray for them,
in order to discharge my debt of gratitude, but never shall I
be able to do so completely. If thou choosest, slay me for
doing that."</p>

<p>Rashid was moved at this recital, and let him go. He also
gave a general permission to the poets to bewail the tragic end
of the Barmecides. A pathetic anecdote relating to their fall
is recorded by Muhammad, son of Abdur Bahman the
Hashimite.</p>

<p>"Having gone to visit my mother on the day of the Feast
of Sacrifice, I found her talking with an old woman of ven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>erable
appearance, but meanly clad. My mother asked if I
knew her, and I answered, 'No.' She replied: 'It is Abbadab,
the mother of Jafar Bin Yahya.' I turned to her and
saluted her with respect. After some time I said to her:
'Madam, what is the strangest thing you have seen?' 'My
friend,' she replied, 'there was once a time when this same
festival saw me escorted by four hundred slaves, and still I
thought that my son was not sufficiently grateful to me. To-day
the feast has returned, and all I wish for is two sheepskins—one
to lie down on and one to cover me.'</p>

<p>"I gave her," adds the narrator, "five hundred dirhems,
and she nearly died of joy. She did not cease her visits till
the day death separated us."</p>

<p>After the destruction of this family, the affairs of Rashid
fell into irretrievable confusion. Treason, revolt, and rebellion
assailed him in different parts of the empire. He himself
became a prey to disease, and was tortured by unavailing
remorse. If any one blamed the Barmecides in his presence
he would say: "Cease to blame them or fill the void." So
great was the disaffection aroused by his treatment of them
that he removed the seat of government from Bagdad to Rakkah,
on the Euphrates.</p>

<p>Yahya, the father of Jafar and Fadhl, died in prison, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
805. On his body was found a paper containing these words:
"The accuser has gone on before to the tribunal, and the accused
shall follow soon. The Cadi will be that just Judge
who never errs and who needs no witnesses." This, being reported
to Rashid, deepened his gloom, which began to wear the
appearance of madness. One morning his physician, finding
him greatly discomposed, inquired the reason. Rashid replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
"I will describe to thee what presented itself to my
imagination. Methought I saw an arm suddenly extend itself
from beneath my pillow, holding in the palm of the hand
a quantity of red earth, while a voice addressed me in the following
words: 'Haroun, behold this handful of earth; it
is that in which they are about to bury thee.' I demanded to
know where I was about to find my grave, and the voice replied:
'At Tus.' The arm disappeared and I awoke."</p>

<p>Shortly after this Rashid, though suffering from the disease
which was to end his life, set out to put down a rebellion
in Transoxiana. When one of the captured rebel leaders was
brought into his presence, he ordered him to be cut to pieces
limb by limb on the spot.</p>

<p>When the execution was over Rashid fell into a swoon, and,
on recovering himself, asked his physician if he did not
recollect the dream which had occurred to him at Rakkah, for
they were now in the neighborhood of Tus. He also desired
his chamberlain Mesrour to bring him a sample of the native
earth of the country. When Mesrour returned with his naked
arm extended, Rashid immediately exclaimed: "Behold the
arm and the earth, precisely as they appeared in my dream!"</p>

<p>The Caliph died at midnight the following Saturday,
March 23, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 809.</p>


<h5>THE CALIPH AL MAMOUN</h5>

<p>When Haroun al Rashid died he left the empire to his sons
Emin and Mamoun, giving the former Irak and Syria, and
the latter Khorassan and Persia. Emin had the title of
Caliph, to which Mamoun was to succeed. War broke out
between the brothers; Emin fled from Bagdad, but was captured
and slain, and his head sent to Mamoun in Khorassan,
who wept at the sight of it. He had, however, previously,
when his general Tahir sent to him requesting to know what to
do with Emin in case he caught him, sent to the general a
shirt with no opening in it for the head. By this Tahir knew
that he wished Emin to be put to death, and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>The Caliph, however, bore a grudge against Tahir for the
death of his brother, as was shown by the following circumstance:
Tahir went one day to ask some favor from Al Mamoun;
the latter granted it, and then wept till his eyes were
bathed in tears. "Commander of the Faithful," said Tahir,
"why do you weep? May God never cause you to shed a
tear! The universe obeys you, and you have obtained your
utmost wishes." "I weep not," replied the Caliph,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> "from
any humiliation which may have befallen me, neither do I
weep from grief, but my mind is never free from cares."</p>

<p>These words gave great uneasiness to Tahir, and, on retiring,
he said to Husain, the eunuch who waited at the door
of the Caliph's private apartment: "I wish you to ask the
Commander of the Faithful why he wept on seeing me." On
reaching home Tahir sent Husain one hundred thousand dirhems.
Some time afterward, when Al Mamoun was alone and
in a good humor, Husain said to him: "Why did you weep
when Tahir came to see you?" "What is that to you?" replied
the Prince. "It made me sad to see you weep," answered
the eunuch. "I shall tell you the reason," the Caliph
said; "but if you ever allow it to pass your lips, I shall have
your head taken off." "O my master," the eunuch replied,
"did I ever disclose any of your secrets?" "I was thinking
of my brother Emin," said the Caliph, "and of the misfortune
which befell him, so that I was nearly choked with weeping;
but Tahir shall not escape me! I shall make him feel
what he will not like."</p>

<p>Husain related this to Tahir, who immediately rode off to
the Vizier Abi Khalid, and said to him: "I am not parsimonious
in my gratitude, and a service rendered to me is never
lost; contrive to have me removed away from Al Mamoun."
"I shall," replied Abi Khalid. "Come to me to-morrow
morning." He then rode off to Al Mamoun, and said: "I
was not able to sleep last night." "Why so?" asked the
Caliph. "Because you have entrusted Ghassan with the government
of Khorassan, and his friends are very few, and I
fear that ruin awaits him." "And whom do you think a
proper person for it?" said Al Mamoun. "Tahir," replied
Abi Khalid. "He is ambitious," observed the Caliph. "I
will answer for his conduct," said the other.</p>

<p>Al Mamoun then sent for Tahir, and named him governor
of Khorassan on the spot; he made him also a present of an
eunuch, to whom he had just given orders to poison his new
master if he remarked anything suspicious in his conduct.
When Tahir was solidly established in his government he
ceased mentioning Al Mamoun's name in the public prayers
as the reigning Caliph. A dispatch was immediately sent off
by express to inform Al Mamoun of the circumstance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the next morning Tahir was found dead in his bed. It is
said that the eunuch administered the poison to him in some
sauce.</p>

<p>Al Mamoun placed his two sons under the tuition of Al
Farra, so that they might be instructed in grammar. One
day Al Farra rose to leave the house, and the two young
princes hastened to bring his shoes. They struggled between
themselves for the honor of offering them to him, and they
finally agreed that each of them should present him with one
slipper. As Al Mamoun had secret agents who informed him
of everything that passed, he learned what had taken place,
and caused Al Farra to be brought before him.</p>

<p>When he entered, the Caliph said to him: "Who is the
most honored of men?" Al Farra answered: "I know not
any one more honored than the Commander of the Faithful."
"Nay," replied Al Mamoun, "it is he who arose to go out, and
the two designated successors of the Commander of the Faithful
contended for the honor of presenting him his slippers,
and at length agreed that each of them should offer him
one."</p>

<p>Al Farra answered: "Commander of the Faithful, I should
have prevented them from doing so had I not been apprehensive
of discouraging their minds in the pursuit of that excellence
to which they ardently aspire. We know by tradition
that Ibn Abbas held the stirrups of Hasan and Husain,
when they were getting on horseback after paying him a visit.
One of those who were present said to him: 'How is it that
you hold the stirrups of these striplings, you who are their
elder?' To which he replied: 'Ignorant man! No one
can appreciate the merit of people of merit except a man of
merit.'"</p>

<p>Al Mamoun then said to him: "Had you prevented them,
I should have declared you in fault. That which they have
done is no debasement of their dignity; on the contrary, it exalts
their merit. No man, though great in rank, can be dispensed
from three obligations: he must respect his sovereign,
venerate his father, and honor his preceptor. As a reward
for their conduct, I bestow upon them twenty thousand dinars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
($50,000), and on you for the good education you give them,
ten thousand dirhems" ($2,500).</p>

<p>When Al Mamoun was still in Khorassan, a revolt was
raised against him in Bagdad by his uncle, Ibrahim, the son
of Mahdi. This prince had great talent as a singer, and was
a skilful performer on musical instruments. Being of a dark
complexion, which he inherited from his mother, Shikla, who
was a negress, and of a large frame of body, he received the
name of At-Tinnin (the Dragon). He was proclaimed
Caliph at Bagdad during the absence of Al Mamoun. The
cause which led the people to renounce Al Mamoun and choose
Ibrahim was that the former had chosen as his successor one
of the descendants of Ali, and in doing so had ordered the
public to cease wearing black, which was the distinctive color
of the Abbassides, the reigning family, and to put on green,
the color of the family of Ali and their partizans.</p>

<p>On Mamoun's entry into Bagdad, Ibrahim fled disguised as
a woman. He was, however, detected and arrested by one of
the negro police. When he was before Al Mamoun, who addressed
him in ironic terms, he replied: "Prince of the believers,
my crime gives you the right of retaliation, but 'forgiveness
is near neighbor to piety.'<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> God has placed you
above all those who are generous, as he has placed me above all
criminals in the magnitude of my crime. If you punish me
you will be just; if you pardon me you will be great." "Then
I pardon you," said Mamoun, and prostrated himself in
prayer.</p>

<p>He commanded, however, that Ibrahim should continue to
wear the <i>burqa</i>, or long female veil in which he had fled, so
that people might see in what disguise he had been arrested;
he ordered also that he should be exposed to view in the palace
courtyard; then he committed him to police supervision, and
finally, after some days of detention, set him free.</p>

<p>The following anecdote was related by Ibrahim regarding
the time when he was in hiding with a price set on his head:
"I went out one day at the hour of noon without knowing
whither I was going. I found myself in a narrow street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
which ended in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, and noticed a negro standing in
front of the door of a house. I went straight to him, and
asked if he could afford me shelter for a short time. He consented,
and bade me enter. The hall was adorned with mats
and leather cushions. Then he left me alone, closed the door,
and departed. A suspicion flashed across my mind; this man
knew that a price was set on my head, and had gone to denounce
me.</p>

<p>"While I was revolving these gloomy thoughts, he returned
with a servant bearing a tray loaded with victuals. 'May my
life be a sacrifice for you,' he said. 'I am a barber, and therefore
I have not touched any of these things with my hand; do
me the honor to partake of them.' Hunger pressed me; I rose
and obeyed. 'What about some wine?' he asked. 'I do
not detest it,' I replied. He brought some, and then said
again: 'May my life be your ransom! Will you allow me
to sit near you and drink to your health?' I consented.
After having emptied three cups, he opened a cupboard and
took out a lute. 'Sir,' he said, 'it does not behoove a man
of my low degree to beg you to sing, but your kindness
prompts me to do so; if you deign to consent it will be a great
honor for your slave.'</p>

<p>"'How do you know that I am a good singer?' I asked
him. 'By Allah!' he answered, with an air of astonishment,
'your reputation is too great for me not to know it:
you are Ibrahim, the son of Mahdi, and a reward of a hundred
thousand dirhems is promised by Al Mamoun to the man
who will find you.' At these words I took the lute, and was
about to commence, when he added: 'Sir, would you be so
kind as first to sing the piece which I shall choose?' When
I consented he chose three airs in which I had no rival. Then
I said to him: 'You know me, I admit; but where did you
learn to know these three airs?' 'I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>,' he answered,
'in the service of Ishak, son of Ibrahim Mausili,<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and I have
often heard him speak of the great singers and the airs in
which they excelled; but who could have guessed that I would
hear you myself and in my own house?'</p>

<p>"I sang to him accordingly, and remained some time in
his company, charmed with his agreeable manners. At nightfall
I took leave of him. I had brought with me a purse full
of gold pieces; I offered it to him, promising him a greater
reward some day. This is strange,' he said; 'it is rather
I who should offer you all I possess, and implore you to do
me the honor to accept it. Only respect has restrained me
from doing so.' He refused, accordingly, to receive anything
from me; but he went out with me and put me on the
road to the place whither I wished to go. Then he went off,
and I have never seen him since."</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Al Mamoun and Ibrahim, the Son of Mahdi</i></p>

<p>One day ten inhabitants of Basra were denounced to Al
Mamoun as heretics who held the doctrine of Manes (Manichæans)
and the two principles of light and darkness. He
ordered them to be brought into his presence. A parasite,
who saw them being taken, said to himself: "Here are folk
who are going off for a jollification." He slipped in among
them, and accompanied them without perceiving who they
were till they reached the boat in which their guards made
them embark. "Doubtless this is a pleasure party!" he exclaimed,
and went on board with them. Soon, however, the
guards brought chains and fettered the whole band, including
the parasite, who said to himself: "My greediness has ended
by making me a prisoner." Then he addressed the seniors of
the band: "Pardon me," he said; "may I ask who you
are?" "Tell us, rather, who <i>you</i> are," they answered,
"and whether we may reckon you among our brothers."
"God knows I scarcely know you," he replied. "As
for me, to tell the truth, I am a professional parasite. When
I left my home this morning I happened to fall in with you.
Struck with your agreeable appearance and good manners, I
said to myself: 'Here are some well-to-do people going to
enjoy themselves.' Consequently I joined your company,
and took my place beside you as though I were one of you.
When we reached the boat, which was provided with carpets
and cushions, and I saw all these bags and well-filled baskets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
I thought: 'They are going for an outing in some park or
pleasure-ground; this is a lucky day for me.'</p>

<p>"I was still congratulating myself when the guards came
and fettered you, and me with you. I now feel quite bewildered;
tell me, therefore, what it is all about." These
words amused the prisoners, and made them smile. They
replied: "Now that you are on the list of the suspected, and
are chained, know that we are Manichæans who have been
denounced to Mamoun, and are being taken to him. He will
ask us who we are, will question us concerning our belief,
and will exhort us to repent and to abjure our religion, proposing
various tests to us; he will, for example, show us an
image of Manes, commanding us to spit upon it and to renounce
him; he will command us to sacrifice a pheasant.
Whoever will do so will save his life; whoever refuses will
be put to death. When you are called and put to the test
you will say who you are and what your belief is, according
as you feel prompted. But did you not say you were a
parasite? Now, such people have an ample store of anecdotes
and stories; shorten our journey, then, by recounting
some."</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at Bagdad the prisoners were conducted
into the presence of Mamoun. He called each in
turn as his name was on the list; he asked each concerning
his sect, and urged them to renounce Manes, showing them his
image, and commanding them to spit on it. As they refused,
he had them handed over one by one to the executioner.</p>

<p>At last the parasite's turn came. But as the ten prisoners
had been done with and the list was exhausted, Mamoun
asked the guards who he was. "Truly, we know nothing
about him," they answered. "We found him among them
and brought him hither." "Who are you?" the Caliph asked
him. "Prince of the believers," he said, "may my wife be
divorced if I understand what they are talking about! I
am only a poor parasite." And he told him his whole story
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The Caliph was much amused, and ordered the image of
Manes to be presented to him; the parasite cursed and re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>nounced
the heretic heartily. Al Mamoun, however, was
about to punish him for his temerity and impudence, when
Ibrahim, the son of Mahdi, who was present, said: "Sire,
let this man off, and I will relate to you a kind of Bohemian
adventure, of which I was the hero." The Caliph assented,
and Ibrahim continued:</p>

<p>"Prince of the believers, I had gone out one day, and was
roving at random through the streets of Bagdad, when I
came to the porch of a lofty mansion, whence issued a delicious
odor of spices and dressed meats, by which I was
strongly attracted. I addressed a passer-by, and asked to
whom the house belonged. 'To a linen-merchant,' he answered.
'What is his name?' I asked. 'Such a one, son of
such a one,' was his reply. I lifted my eyes to the house.
Through the lattice-work which covered one of the windows
I saw appear such a beautiful hand and wrist as I had never
seen before. The charm of this apparition made me forget
the enticing odors, and I stood there troubled and perplexed.
Finally, I asked the man, who had remained standing near,
if the master of the house ever gave entertainments. 'Yes,
I think he is giving one to-day,' he answered; 'but his guests
are merchants, staid and sober people like himself.'</p>

<p>"We were thus engaged in talk when two persons of well-to-do
appearance came down the street toward us. 'There
are his two guests,' the man said to me. 'What are their
names and their fathers' names?' I asked. He informed
me, and I accosted them immediately, saying: 'May my life
be your sacrifice; your host is waiting impatiently for you.'
I escorted them to the door as if I belonged to the house; they
went in, and I followed. The master of the house perceived
me, and, supposing that I had been brought by his friends,
received me graciously, and placed me in the seat of honor.
Then the meal was brought; it was well served, and we did
honor to the dishes, whose savor excelled their odor. When
the food had been removed and we had washed our hands,
our host led us into another hall richly adorned. He redoubled
his politeness toward me, and specially addressed
his conversation to me. The two guests believed me to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
an intimate friend of his, while the host treated me in this
fashion because he believed I had been brought by his two
friends.</p>

<p>"We had already emptied several cups when a young
female slave came forward, as graceful as a willow-branch,
and saluted us without timidity. She was offered a cushion
to sit upon, and a lute was brought to her, which she tuned
with a skill which struck me. She then sang an air in a
most enchanting fashion; so great was the skill and art with
which she sang that I could not suppress a feeling of jealousy.
'Young girl,' I said to her, 'you have still a good deal
to learn.' These words irritated her; she threw down the
lute, and exclaimed to the host: 'Since when do you admit to
your intimacy such vexatious guests?'</p>

<p>"I repented of my remark when I saw the others look at
me askance. 'Is there a lute here?' I asked. 'Yes,' was
the reply. They brought me one, which I tuned to my liking,
and then sang. I had hardly finished when the young
slave cast herself at my feet, and, embracing them, said:
'Sir, pardon me in the name of heaven; I have never heard
that air sung so exquisitely.' Her master and those present
followed her example in praising me; cheerfulness was restored,
and the cups circulated rapidly. I sang again, and
the enthusiasm of my hearers was roused to such a pitch that
I thought they would take leave of their senses. I waited
awhile to let them recover themselves; then, taking my lute
again, I sang for the third time. 'By Allah!' cried the
slave, 'that is what deserves to be called singing!'</p>

<p>"The others, however, were beginning to feel the effects
of the wine; the master of the house, who had a stronger
head than his guests, entrusted them to the care of his own
servants and of theirs, and had them conveyed home. I
remained alone with him. After we had emptied some more
cups, he said to me: 'Truly, sir, I consider the past days of
my life, in which I did not know you, wasted. Kindly inform
me who you are.' He pressed me so much that at last
I told him my name. Immediately he rose, kissed my hand,
and said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> 'I should have been surprised, sir, had any one of
a rank inferior to your own possessed such skill. To think
one of the royal house was with me all the time, and I knew
it not!' Being pressed by him to tell my story and what
had attracted me to his house, I told him how I had stopped
when I smelt the odor of the food, and described the hand
and wrist I had seen at the window.</p>

<p>"He straightway called one of his female slaves and said:
'Go and tell So-and-so to come down.' He had all the slaves
in succession brought before me. After having examined
their hands, I said: 'No! the possessor of the hand I saw
is not among them.' 'By Allah!' said my host, 'there are
only my mother and my sister left! I will send for them.'
Such generosity and kindness of heart surprised me. I
said to him: 'May my life be your sacrifice! Before calling
your mother, call your sister; it is probably she of whom
I am in search.' 'Very well,' he said, and sent for her.</p>

<p>"As soon as I set eyes on her hand and wrist I cried:
'It is she, my dear host, it is she!' Without losing a moment,
he ordered his servants to bring together ten respectable
elderly men from the neighborhood. They came; he then
sent for a sum of twenty thousand dirhems in two bags, and,
addressing the ten men, said: 'I take you to witness that I
give my sister here in marriage to Ibrahim, son of Mahdi, and
that I bestow upon her a dowry of twenty thousand dirhems.'
His sister and I both gave our agreement to the marriage,
after which I gave one of the bags of money to my young
wife, and distributed the other among the witnesses, saying:
'Excuse me, but this is all I have by me at present.' They
accepted my present and retired.</p>

<p>"My host then proposed to prepare in his own house an
apartment for us. Such generosity and kindness made me
feel quite embarrassed. I said that I only desired a litter
to convey my wife. He readily agreed, and sent along with
it so magnificent a trousseau that it entirely fills one of my
houses."</p>

<p>Mamoun was astonished at the generosity of the merchant.
He granted his freedom and a rich present to the parasite,
and ordered Ibrahim to present his father-in-law at court.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
The latter became one of the most intimate courtiers and
companions of the Caliph.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Death of Al Mamoun</i></p>

<p>During Al Mamoun's last campaign against the Greek Emperor
he arrived at the River Qushairah, and encamped on
its banks. Charmed by the clearness and purity of its waters,
and by the beauty and fertility of the surrounding country,
he had a kind of arbor constructed by the banks of the
stream, intending to rest there some days. So clear was the
water that the inscription on a coin lying at the bottom could
be clearly read; but it was so cold that it was impossible for
any one to bathe in it.</p>

<p>All at once a fish, about a fathom in length and flashing
like an ingot of silver, appeared in the water. The Caliph
promised a reward to any one who would capture it; an
attendant went down, caught the fish and regained the shore,
but as he approached the spot where Al Mamoun was sitting,
the fish slipped from his grasp, fell into the water, and sank
like a stone to the bottom. Some of the water was splashed
on the Caliph's neck, chest, and arms, and wetted his clothes.
The attendant went down again, recaptured the fish, and
placed it, wriggling, in a napkin before the Caliph. Just as
he had ordered it to be fried, Al Mamoun felt a sudden shiver,
and could not move from the place. In vain he was covered
with rugs and skins; he trembled like a leaf, and exclaimed:
"I am cold! I am cold!" He was carried into his tent,
covered with clothes, and a fire was lit, but he continued to
complain of cold. When the fish had been cooked it was
brought to him, but he could neither taste nor touch it, so
great was his suffering.</p>

<p>As he grew rapidly worse, his brother Mutasim questioned
Bakhteshou and Ibn Masouyieh, his physicians, on his condition,
and whether they could do him any good. Ibn
Masouyieh took one of the patient's hands and Bakhteshou
the other, and felt his pulse together; the irregular pulsations
heralded his dissolution. Just then Al Mamoun awoke out
of his stupor; he opened his eyes, and caused some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
natives of the place to be sent for, and questioned them
regarding the stream and the locality. When asked regarding
the meaning of the name "Qushairah" they replied that
it signified "Stretch out thy feet" (<i>i.e.</i>, "die"). Al Mamoun
then inquired the Arabic name of the country, and was
told "Rakkah." Now, the horoscope drawn at the moment
of his birth announced that he would die in a place of that
name; therefore he had always avoided residing in the city
of Rakkah, fearing to die there. When he heard the answer
given by these people, he felt sure that this was the place
predicted by his horoscope. Feeling himself becoming worse,
he commanded that he should be carried outside his tent in
order to survey his camp and his army once more. It was
now night-time. As his gaze wandered over the long lines
of the camp and the lights twinkling into the distance, he
cried: "O thou whose reign will never end, have mercy on
him whose reign is now ending." He was then carried back
to his bed. Mutasim, seeing that he was sinking, commanded
some one to whisper in his ear the confession of the
Mohammedan faith ("There is no God but God, and Mohammed
is the Apostle of God"). As the attendant was about
to speak, in order that Al Mamoun might repeat the words
after him, Ibn Masouyieh said to him: "Do not speak, for
truly he could not now distinguish between God and Manes."
The dying man opened his eyes—they seemed extraordinarily
large, and shone with a wonderful luster; his hands
clutched at the doctor; he tried to speak to him, but could
not; then his eyes turned toward heaven and filled with
tears; finally his tongue was loosened, and he spoke: "O thou
who diest not, have mercy on him who dies," and he expired
immediately. His body was carried to Tarsus and
buried there.</p>

<h4><a name="ON_MEDICINE" id="ON_MEDICINE">ON MEDICINE</a><br />

<small>(BY AVICENNA)</small></h4>


<p>Medicine considers the human body as to the means by
which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health.
The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is
not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes.
Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness
and health. And because health and sickness and their
causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and
not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms,
we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now
it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired
save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has
had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge
of its accidents and accompanying essentials. Of these
causes there are four kinds: material, efficient, formal, and
final.</p>

<p>Material causes, on which health and sickness depend, are—the
affected member, which is the immediate subject, and
the humors; and in these are the elements. And these two
are subjects that, according to their mixing together, alter.
In the composition and alteration of the substance which is
thus composed, a certain unity is attained.</p>

<p>Efficient causes are the causes changing and preserving the
conditions of the human body; as airs, and what are united
with them; and evacuation and retention; and districts and
cities, and habitable places, and what are united with them;
and changes in age and diversities in it, and in races and
arts and manners, and bodily and animate movings and
restings, and sleepings and wakings on account of them; and
in things which befall the human body when they touch it,
and are either in accordance or at variance with nature.</p>

<p>Formal causes are physical constitutions, and combinations
and virtues which result from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>Pinal causes are operations. And in the science of operations
lies the science of virtues, as we have set forth. These
are the subjects of the doctrine of medicine; whence one
inquires concerning the disease and curing of the human
body. One ought to attain perfection in this research;
namely, how health may be preserved and sickness cured.
And the causes of this kind are rules in eating and drinking,
and the choice of air, and the measure of exercise and
rest; and doctoring with medicines and doctoring with the
hands. All this with physicians is according to three species:
the well, the sick, and the medium of whom we have spoken.</p>

<h4><a name="THE_EXISTING_MONUMENTS" id="THE_EXISTING_MONUMENTS">THE EXISTING MONUMENTS</a><br />

<small>OR "CHRONOLOGY" OF AL BIRUNI</small></h4>

<p class="heading">IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL</p>


<p>Praise be to God who is high above all things, and blessings
be on Mohammed, the elected, the best of all created beings,
and on his family, the guides of righteousness and
truth.</p>

<p>One of the exquisite plans in God's management of the
affairs of his creation, one of the glorious benefits which he
has bestowed upon the entirety of his creatures, is that categorical
decree of his, not to leave in his world any period
without a just guide, whom he constitutes as a protector for
his creatures, with whom to take refuge in unfortunate and
sorrowful cases and accidents, and upon whom to devolve
their affairs, when they seem indissolubly perplexed, so that
the order of the world should rest upon—and its existence
be supported by—his genius. And this decree (that the
affairs of mankind should be governed by a prophet) has
been settled upon them as a religious duty, and has been
linked together with the obedience toward God, and the obedience
toward his prophet, through which alone a reward in
future life may be obtained—in accordance with the word of
him, who is truth and justice—and his word is judgment and
decree, "O ye believers, obey God, and obey the prophets,
and those among yourselves who are invested with the
command."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Era of the Creation.</span>—The first and most famous of
the beginnings of antiquity is the fact of the creation of
mankind. But among those who have a book of divine revelation,
such as the Jews, Christians, Magians, and their various
sects, there exists such a difference of opinion as to the
nature of this fact, and as to the question how to date from it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the like of which is not allowable for eras. Everything, the
knowledge of which is connected with creation and with the
history of bygone generations, is mixed up with falsifications
and myths, because it belongs to a far remote age; because a
long interval separates us therefrom, and because the student
is incapable of keeping it in memory, and of fixing it (so
as to preserve it from confusion). God says: "Have they
not got the stories about those who were before them gone
but God knows them." (Surah ix, 71.) Therefore it is becoming
not to admit any account of a similar subject, if it
is not attested by a book, the correctness of which is relied
upon, or by a tradition, for which the conditions of authenticity,
according to the prevalent opinion, furnish grounds of
proof.</p>

<p>If we now first consider this era, we find a considerable
divergence of opinion regarding it among these nations. For
the Persians and Magians think that the duration of the
world is 12,000 years, corresponding to the number of signs
in the zodiac and of the months; and that Zoroaster, the
founder of their law, thought that of those there had passed,
till the time of his appearance, 3,000 years, intercalated
with the day-quarters, for he himself had made their computation,
and had taken into account that defect, which had
accrued to them on account of the day-quarters, till the time
when they were intercalated and made to agree with real
time. From his appearance to the beginning of the Aera
Alexandri, they count 258 years; therefore they count from
the beginning of the world to Alexander 3,258 years. However,
if we compute the years from the creation of Gayomarth,
whom they hold to be the first man, and sum up the
years of the reign of each of his successors—for the rule
of Iran remained with his descendants without interruption—this
number is, for the time till Alexander, the sum total
of 3,354 years. So the specification of the single items of
the addition does not agree with the sum total.</p>

<p>A section of the Persians is of the opinion that those past
3,000 years which we have mentioned are to be counted from
the creation of Gayomarth; because, before that, already six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
thousand years had elapsed—a time during which the celestial
globe stood motionless, the natures (of created beings)
did not interchange, the elements did not mix—during which
there was no growth, and no decay, and the earth was not
cultivated. Thereupon, when the celestial globe was set a-going,
the first man came into existence on the equator, so that
part of him in longitudinal direction was on the north, and
part south of the line. The animals were reproduced, and
mankind commenced to reproduce their own species and to
multiply; the atoms of the elements mixed, so as to give
rise to growth and decay; the earth was cultivated, and the
world was arranged in conformity with fixed forms.</p>

<p>The Jews and Christians differ widely on this subject;
for, according to the doctrine of the Jews, the time between
Adam and Alexander is 3,448 years, whilst, according to the
Christian doctrine it is 5,180 years. The Christians reproach
the Jews with having diminished the number of
years with the view of making the appearance of Jesus fall
into the fourth millennium in the middle of the seven millennia,
which are, according to their view, the time of the
duration of the world, so as not to coincide with that time at
which, as the prophets after Moses had prophesied, the birth
of Jesus from a pure virgin at the end of time, was to take
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Era of the Deluge.</span>—The next following era is the era
of the great deluge, in which everything perished at the
time of Noah. Here, too, there is such a difference of
opinions, and such a confusion, that you have no chance of
deciding as to the correctness of the matter, and do not even
feel inclined to investigate thoroughly its historical truth.
The reason is, in the first instance, the difference regarding
the period between the Aera Adami and the Deluge, which
we have mentioned already; and secondly, that difference,
which we shall have to mention, regarding the period between
the Deluge and the Aera Alexandri. For the Jews
derive from the Torah, and the following books, for this
latter period 1,792 years, whilst the Christians derive from
<i>their</i> Torah for the same period 2,938 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>The Persians, and the great mass of the Magians, deny the
Deluge altogether; they believe that the rule of the world has
remained with them without any interruption ever since
Gayomarth Gilshah, who was, according to them, the first
man. In denying the Deluge, the Indians, Chinese, and the
various nations of the East, concur with them. Some, however,
of the Persians admit the fact of the Deluge, but they
describe it in a different way from what it is described in
the books of the prophets. They say, a partial deluge occurred
in Syria and the West at the time of Tahmurath, but
it did not extend over the whole of the then civilized world,
and only a few nations were drowned in it; it did not extend
beyond the peak of Hulwan, and did not reach the empires of
the East. Further, they relate, that the inhabitants of the
West, when they were warned by their sages, constructed
buildings of the kind of the two pyramids that have been
built in Egypt, saying: "If the disaster comes from heaven,
we shall go into them; if it comes from the earth, we shall
ascend above them." People are of opinion that the traces
of the water of the Deluge, and the efforts of the waves, are
still visible on these two pyramids half-way up, above which
the water did not rise. Another report says, that Joseph
had made them a magazine where he deposited the bread and
victuals for the years of drought.</p>

<p>It is related that Tahmurath on receiving the warning of
the Deluge—231 years before the Deluge—ordered his
people to select a place of good air and soil in his realm.
Now they did not find a place that answered better to this
description than Ispahan. Thereupon, he ordered all scientific
books to be preserved for posterity and to be buried in
a part of that place least exposed to obnoxious influences. In
favor of this report we may state that in our time in Jay,
the city of Ispahan, there have been discovered hills, which,
on being excavated, disclosed houses, filled with many loads
of that tree-bark with which arrows and shields are covered,
and which is called Tuz, bearing inscriptions, of which no
one was able to say what they are and what they mean.</p>

<p>These discrepancies in their reports inspire doubts in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
student, and make him inclined to believe what is related
in some books, that Gayomarth was not the first man, but that
he was Gomer ben Yaphet ben Noah, that he was a prince
to whom a long life was given, that he settled on the Mount
Dumbawand, where he founded an empire, and that finally
his power became very great, whilst mankind was still living
in elementary conditions, similar to those at the time of
creation and of the first stage of the development of the
world. Then he, and some of his children, took control of the
guidance of the world. Toward the end of his life, he became
tyrannical, and called himself Adam, saying: "If
anybody calls me by another name than this, I shall cut off
his head."</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> we move with Al Ghazali or Zamakhshari
through the deeply searching paths of Arab philosophy,
we feel that we are following the guidance of men
whom modern thought has in no way outgrown. They lacked
much of our scientific knowledge, but none of our reasoning
powers. Al Ghazali has sounded all philosophy's profundities
of thought, and Zamakhshari has soared to theology's
highest peak of adoration.</p>

<p>Al Ghazali (1049-1111), as we have already said, is
often ranked next to Mohammed as a teacher and uplifter
of his Arab brethren. He was a native of Khorassan, named
Abu Hamid Mohammed. Arab custom, however, seldom
designates a noted man by his birth-name. He is most often
honored with the distinctive prefix "Al," which means
"The," much as we use the word as a superlative. Thus
just as Holy Writ speaks of The Nazarine, so Al Ghazali
probably means "The Man of Ghazali," the village of his
birth, though the name may also be derived from his father's
trade in <i>gazzel</i> (thread), and so may mean "The Thread
Merchant." As a youth Al Ghazali studied much and traveled
widely; and his wanderings led, as did those of most
men in his day, to Bagdad. Here he became famed as the
foremost philosophic teacher of the age. But his own philosophy
did not satisfy him. Withdrawing from his official
position on the ground of ill-health, he wandered over the
world for eleven years, seeking true wisdom. He felt at
last that he had found it in the ecstasy of religious faith;
and then, resuming his public teaching, he led an earnest
reform in Mohammedanism, bringing his people to look
more deeply and nobly upon their faith. So convincing were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
his appeals and explanations that his people called him
"The Decisive Argument for the Faith."</p>

<p>Al Ghazali's own search for truth is told in his remarkable
little book here given in full, "The Rescuer from Error," in
which the Rescuer is Mohammed with his Koran. Al Ghazali
wrote many other works, religious and philosophical,
but none which have so profoundly touched modern readers
as this simple, earnest account of himself. It is a "confession"
worthy to rank with the "Confessions of Saint Augustine,"
or any greatest work of its own type. Al Ghazali
soon afterward withdrew from public life, hoping to
teach men more by his books than by spoken words, and he
died in seclusion in his native home.</p>

<p>Great as was the influence of Al Ghazali, he was scarcely
a typical Mohammedan teacher. He was, as his book will
show, an independent thinker who reached his firm religious
faith only after seeking through all systems of philosophy.
He had tasted of the emptiness of materialism, and had faced
the black shadows of despair. Of far other type was Zamakhshari,
the most renowned of commentators on the Koran.
He seems never to have doubted the divinity of the
holy book. He spent years in studying it, and while he
used keen intelligence in weighing its every word, and even
shocked his narrower coreligionists by the freedom of his
criticism, yet it was always criticism based on the assumption
that of course the Koran was right, and that the only
danger lay in that men might blunder in interpreting its
meaning. He therefore called his celebrated commentary the
"Kashshaf," or "Discoverer of Truth."</p>

<p>We give here the noted opening of this work. The main
attack upon the author by the orthodox Mohammedans of a
later age was because the commentary began with the words,
"Praise be to God who created the Koran," whereas the orthodox
regarded the book as always existent with God, so
that instead of "created" they would have had the writer
say that God "revealed" the Koran.</p>

<p>Zamakhshari (1070-1143) was born and died in Khiva in
Turkestan. He was, however, another of the many youths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
eager for knowledge who took advantage of the wide-spread
dominion of the Arab caliphs to travel far through the East.
He journeyed indeed through such hardships that he lost a
leg, frozen in a snowstorm; and he dwelt so long in Mecca,
the holy city, that he was called the "neighbor of God." It
was from such earnest men as Zamakhshari and Al Ghazali,
the "neighbor of God" and the "Decisive Argument,"
that the Mohammedan religion learned its final form, and
the reader will be ignoring the real and manifest energy and
intellect of these great men if he dismisses their religion
lightly as a teaching easily to be disproved or childishly
defective.</p>

<h4>THE RESCUER FROM ERROR</h4>

<p class="heading">IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD</p>


<p>Quoth the Imam Ghazali:</p>

<p>Glory be to God, whose praise should precede every writing
and every speech! May the blessings of God rest on
Mohammed, his Prophet and his Apostle, on his family and
companions, by whose guidance error is escaped!</p>

<p>You have asked me, O brother in the faith, to expound
the aim and the mysteries of religious sciences, the boundaries
and depths of theological doctrines. You wish to know
my experiences while disentangling truth lost in the medley
of sects and divergencies of thought, and how I have dared
to climb from the low levels of traditional belief to the topmost
summit of assurance. You desire to learn what I
have borrowed, first of all from scholastic theology; and secondly
from the method of the Ta'limites, who, in seeking
truth, rest upon the authority of a leader; and why, thirdly,
I have been led to reject philosophic systems; and finally,
what I have accepted of the doctrine of the Sufis, and the sum
total of truth which I have gathered in studying every
variety of opinion. You ask me why, after resigning at
Bagdad a teaching post which attracted a number of hearers,
I have, long afterward, accepted a similar one at Nishapur.
Convinced as I am of the sincerity which prompts your inquiries,
I proceed to answer them, invoking the help and
protection of God.</p>

<p>Know then, my brothers (may God direct you in the right
way), that the diversity in beliefs and religions, and the
variety of doctrines and sects which divide men, are like a
deep ocean strewn with shipwrecks, from which very few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
escape safe and sound. Each sect, it is true, believes itself
in possession of the truth and of salvation, "each party," as
the Koran saith, "rejoices in its own creed"; but as the
chief of the apostles, whose word is always truthful, has told
us, "My people will be divided into more than seventy
sects, of whom only one will be saved." This prediction,
like all others of the Prophet, must be fulfilled.</p>

<p>From the period of adolescence, that is to say, previous to
reaching my twentieth year to the present time when I have
passed my fiftieth, I have ventured into this vast ocean; I
have fearlessly sounded its depths, and like a resolute diver,
I have penetrated its darkness and dared its dangers and
abysses. I have interrogated the beliefs of each sect and
scrutinized the mysteries of each doctrine, in order to disentangle
truth from error and orthodoxy from heresy. I
have never met one who maintained the hidden meaning of
the Koran without investigating the nature of his belief,
nor a partizan of its exterior sense without inquiring into the
results of his doctrine. There is no philosopher whose system
I have not fathomed, nor theologian the intricacies of
whose doctrine I have not followed out.</p>

<p>Sufism has no secrets into which I have not penetrated;
the devout adorer of Deity has revealed to me the aim of his
austerities; the atheist has not been able to conceal from me
the real reason of his unbelief. The thirst for knowledge
was innate in me from an early age; it was like a second
nature implanted by God, without any will on my part. No
sooner had I emerged from boyhood than I had already
broken the fetters of tradition and freed myself from hereditary
beliefs.</p>

<p>Having noticed how easily the children of Christians become
Christians, and the children of Moslems embrace Islam,
and remembering also the traditional saying ascribed to the
Prophet, "Every child has in him the germ of Islam, then
his parents make him Jew, Christian, or Zoroastrian," I was
moved by a keen desire to learn what was this innate disposition
in the child, the nature of the accidental beliefs imposed
on him by the authority of his parents and his masters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
finally the unreasoned convictions which he derives from
their instructions.</p>

<p>Struck with the contradictions which I encountered in endeavoring
to disentangle the truth and falsehood of these
opinions, I was led to make the following reflection: "The
search after truth being the aim which I propose to myself,
I ought in the first place to ascertain what are the bases of
certitude." In the next place I recognized that certitude is
the clear and complete knowledge of things, such knowledge
as leaves no room for doubt nor possibility of error and conjecture,
so that there remains no room in the mind for error
to find an entrance. In such a case it is necessary that the
mind, fortified against all possibility of going astray, should
embrace such a strong conviction that, if, for example, any
one possessing the power of changing a stone into gold, or a
stick into a serpent, should seek to shake the bases of this
certitude, it would remain firm and immovable. Suppose,
for instance, a man should come and say to me, who am
firmly convinced that ten is more than three, "No; on the
contrary, three is more than ten, and, to prove it, I change
this rod into a serpent," and supposing that he actually did
so, I should remain none the less convinced of the falsity of
his assertion, and although his miracle might arouse my
astonishment, it would not instil any doubt into my belief.</p>

<p>I then understood that all forms of knowledge which do not
unite these conditions (imperviousness to doubt, etc.) do not
deserve any confidence, because they are not beyond the reach
of doubt, and what is not impregnable to doubt can not constitute
certitude.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Subterfuges of the Sophists</i></p>

<p>I then examined what knowledge I possessed, and discovered
that in none of it, with the exception of sense-perceptions
and necessary principles, did I enjoy that degree of
certitude which I have just described. I then sadly reflected
as follows: "We can not hope to find truth except in
matters which carry their evidence in themselves—that is
to say, in sense-perceptions and necessary principles; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
must therefore establish these on a firm basis. Is my absolute
confidence in sense-perceptions and on the infallibility
of necessary principles analogous to the confidence which I
formerly possessed in matters believed on the authority of
others? Is it only analogous to the reliance most people
place on their organs of vision, or is it rigorously true without
admixture of illusion or doubt?"</p>

<p>I then set myself earnestly to examine the notions we derive
from the evidence of the senses and from sight in order to
see if they could be called in question. The result of a
careful examination was that my confidence in them was
shaken. Our sight, for instance, perhaps the best practised
of all our senses, observes a shadow, and finding it apparently
stationary pronounces it devoid of movement. Observation
and experience, however, show subsequently that a
shadow moves not suddenly, it is true, but gradually and imperceptibly,
so that it is never really motionless.</p>

<p>Again, the eye sees a star and believes it as large as a
piece of gold, but mathematical calculations prove, on the
contrary, that it is larger than the earth. These notions, and
all others which the senses declare true, are subsequently
contradicted and convicted of falsity in an irrefragable manner
by the verdict of reason.</p>

<p>Then I reflected in myself: "Since I can not trust to the
evidence of my senses, I must rely only on intellectual notions
based on fundamental principles, such as the following
axioms: 'Ten is more than three. Affirmation and negation
can not coexist together. A thing can not both be created
and also existent from eternity, living and annihilated
simultaneously, at once necessary and impossible.'" To this
the notions I derived from my senses made the following
objections:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> "Who can guarantee you that you can trust to
the evidence of reason more than to that of the senses? You
believed in our testimony till it was contradicted by the verdict
of reason, otherwise you would have continued to believe
it to this day. Well, perhaps, there is above reason another
judge who, if he appeared, would convict reason of falsehood,
just as reason has confuted us. And if such a third arbiter
is not yet apparent, it does not follow that he does not
exist."</p>

<p>To this argument I remained some time without reply;
a reflection drawn from the phenomena of sleep deepened my
doubt. "Do you not see," I reflected, "that while asleep
you assume your dreams to be indisputably real? Once
awake, you recognize them for what they are—baseless
chimeras. Who can assure you, then, of the reliability of
notions which, when awake, you derive from the senses and
from reason? In relation to your present state they may be
real; but it is possible also that you may enter upon another
state of being which will bear the same relation to your
present state as this does to your condition when asleep. In
that new sphere you will recognize that the conclusions of
reason are only chimeras."</p>

<p>This possible condition is, perhaps, that which the Sufis
call "ecstasy" (<i>hal</i>), that is to say, according to them, a
state in which, absorbed in themselves and in the suspension
of sense-perceptions, they have visions beyond the reach of
intellect. Perhaps also Death is that state, according to that
saying of the prince of prophets: "Men are asleep; when they
die, they wake." Our present life in relation to the future
is perhaps only a dream, and man, once dead, will see things
in direct opposition to those now before his eyes; he will then
understand that word of the Koran, "To-day we have removed
the veil from thine eyes and thy sight is keen."</p>

<p>Such thoughts as these threatened to shake my reason, and
I sought to find an escape from them. But how? In order
to disentangle the knot of this difficulty, a proof was necessary.
Now a proof must be based on primary assumptions,
and it was precisely these of which I was in doubt. This
unhappy state lasted about two months, during which I was,
not, it is true, explicitly or by profession, but morally and
essentially, a thorough-going skeptic.</p>

<p>God at last deigned to heal me of this mental malady; my
mind recovered sanity and equilibrium, the primary assumptions
of reason recovered with me all their stringency and
force. I owed my deliverance, not to a concatenation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
proofs and arguments, but to the light which God caused to
penetrate into my heart—the light which illuminates the
threshold of all knowledge. To suppose that certitude can
be only based upon formal arguments is to limit the boundless
mercy of God. Some one asked the Prophet the explanation
of this passage in the Divine Book: "God opens
to Islam the heart of him whom he chooses to direct." "That
is spoken," replied the Prophet, "of the light which God
sheds in the heart." "And how can man recognize that
light?" he was asked. "By his detachment from this world
of illusion and by a secret drawing toward the eternal world,"
the Prophet replied.</p>

<p>On another occasion he said: "God has created his creatures
in darkness, and then has shed upon them his light."
It is by the help of this light that the search for truth must
be carried on. As by his mercy this light descends from time
to time among men, we must ceaselessly be on the watch for
it. This is also corroborated by another saying of the Apostle:
"God sends upon you, at certain times, breathings of
his grace; be prepared for them."</p>

<p>My object in this account is to make others understand
with what earnestness we should search for truth, since it
leads to results we never dreamed of. Primary assumptions
have not got to be sought for, since they are always present
to our minds; if we engage in such a search, we only find
them persistently elude our grasp. But those who push their
investigation beyond ordinary limits are safe from the suspicion
of negligence in pursuing what is within their reach.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Different Kinds of Seekers after Truth</i></p>

<p>When God in the abundance of his mercy had healed me
of this malady, I ascertained that those who are engaged in
the search for truth may be divided into three groups.</p>

<p>I. Scholastic theologians, who profess to follow theory and
speculation.</p>

<p>II. The philosophers, who profess to rely upon formal
logic.</p>

<p>III. The Sufis, who call themselves the elect of God and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
possessors of intuition and knowledge of the truth by means
of ecstasy.</p>

<p>"The truth," I said to myself, "must be found among
these three classes of men who devote themselves to the search
for it. If it escapes them, one must give up all hope of attaining
it. Having once surrendered blind belief, it is impossible
to return to it, for the essence of such belief is to be
unconscious of itself. As soon as this unconsciousness ceases
it is shattered like a glass whose fragments can not be again
reunited except by being cast again into the furnace and refashioned."
Determined to follow these paths and to search
out these systems to the bottom, I proceeded with my investigations
in the following order: Scholastic theology; philosophical
systems; and, finally Sufism.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Aim of Scholastic Theology and Its Results</i></p>

<p>Commencing with theological science, I carefully studied
and meditated upon it. I read the writings of the authorities
in this department and myself composed several treatises.
I recognized that this science, while sufficing its own requirements,
could not assist me in arriving at the desired goal.
In short, its object is to preserve the purity of orthodox beliefs
from all heretical innovation. God, by means of his
apostle, has revealed to his creatures a belief which is true
as regards their temporal and eternal interests; the chief
articles of it are laid down in the Koran and in the traditions.
Subsequently, Satan suggested to innovators principles
contrary to those of orthodoxy; they listened greedily
to his suggestions, and the purity of the faith was menaced.
God then raised up a school of theologians and inspired them
with the desire to defend orthodoxy by means of a system
of proofs adapted to unveil the devices of the heretics and to
foil the attacks which they made on the doctrines established
by tradition.</p>

<p>Such is the origin of scholastic theology. Many of its
adepts, worthy of their high calling, valiantly defended the
orthodox faith by proving the reality of prophecy and the
falsity of heretical innovations. But, in order to do so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
they had to rely upon a certain number of premises, which
they accepted in common with their adversaries, and which
authority and universal consent or simply the Koran and
the traditions obliged them to accept. Their principal effort
was to expose the self-contradictions of their opponents and
to confute them by means of the premises which they had
professed to accept. Now a method of argumentation like
this has little value for one who only admits self-evident
truths. Scholastic theology could not consequently satisfy
me nor heal the malady from which I suffered.</p>

<p>It is true that in its later development theology was not
content to defend dogma; it betook itself to the study of first
principles, of substances, accidents and the laws which govern
them; but through want of a thoroughly scientific basis,
it could not advance far in its researches, nor succeed in dispelling
entirely the overhanging obscurity which springs
from diversities of belief.</p>

<p>I do not, however, deny that it has had a more satisfactory
result for others; on the contrary, I admit that it has; but
it is by introducing the principle of authority in matters
which are not self-evident. Moreover, my object is to explain
my own mental attitude and not to dispute with those
who have found healing for themselves. Remedies vary
according to the nature of the disease; those which benefit
some may injure others.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Philosophy.</span>—How far it is open to censure or not—On
what points its adherents may be considered believers
or unbelievers, orthodox or heretical—What they have borrowed
from the true doctrine to render their chimerical theories
acceptable—Why the minds of men swerve from the
truth—What criteria are available wherewith to separate
the pure gold from the alloy in their systems.</p>

<p>I proceeded from the study of scholastic theology to that
of philosophy. It was plain to me that, in order to discover
where the professors of any branch of knowledge have erred,
one must make a profound study of that science; must equal,
nay surpass, those who know most of it, so as to penetrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
into secrets of it unknown to them. Only by this method can
they be completely answered, and of this method I can find
no trace in the theologians of Islam. In theological writings
devoted to the refutation of philosophy I have only found
a tangled mass of phrases full of contradictions and mistakes,
and incapable of deceiving, I will not say a critical
mind, but even the common crowd. Convinced that to dream
of refuting a doctrine before having thoroughly comprehended
it was like shooting at an object in the dark, I devoted
myself zealously to the study of philosophy; but in
books only and without the aid of a teacher. I gave up to
this work all the leisure remaining from teaching and from
composing works on law. There were then attending my lectures
three hundred of the students of Bagdad. With the
help of God, these studies, carried on in secret, so to speak,
put me in a condition to thoroughly comprehend philosophical
systems within a space of two years. I then spent about
a year in meditating on these systems after having thoroughly
understood them. I turned them over and over in
my mind till they were thoroughly clear of all obscurity.
In this manner I acquired a complete knowledge of all their
subterfuges and subtleties, of what was truth and what was
illusion in them.</p>

<p>I now proceed to give a <i>résumé</i> of these doctrines. I
ascertained that they were divided into different varieties,
and that their adherents might be ranged under diverse heads.
All, in spite of their diversity, are marked with the stamp
of infidelity and irreligion, although there is a considerable
difference between the ancient and modern, between the first
and last of these philosophers, according as they have missed
or approximated to the truth in a greater or less degree.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Concerning the Philosophical Sects and the Stigma of
Infidelity Which Attaches to Them All</i></p>

<p>The philosophical systems, in spite of their number and
variety, may be reduced to three: (1) the Materialists; (2)
the Naturalists; (3) the Theists.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Materialists.</i> They reject an intelligent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
omnipotent Creator and disposer of the universe. In their
view the world exists from all eternity and had no author.
The animal comes from semen and semen from the animal;
so it had always been and will always be; those who maintain
this doctrine are atheists.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Naturalists.</i> These devote themselves to the study
of nature and of the marvelous phenomena of the animal and
vegetable world. Having carefully analyzed animal organs
with the help of anatomy, struck with the wonders of God's
work and with the wisdom therein revealed, they are forced
to admit the existence of a wise Creator who knows the end
and purpose of everything. And certainly no one can study
anatomy and the wonderful mechanism of living things without
being obliged to confess the profound wisdom of him
who has framed the bodies of animals and especially of man.
But carried away by their natural researches they believed
that the existence of a being absolutely depended upon the
proper equilibrium of its organism. According to them, as
the latter perishes and is destroyed, so is the thinking faculty
which is bound up with it; and as they assert that the restoration
of a thing once destroyed to existence is unthinkable,
they deny the immortality of the soul. Consequently they
deny heaven, hell, resurrection, and judgment. Acknowledging
neither a recompense for good deeds nor a punishment
for evil ones, they fling off all authority and plunge into
sensual pleasures with the avidity of brutes. These also
ought to be called atheists, for the true faith depends not
only on the acknowledgment of God, but of his Apostle and
of the day of judgment. And although they acknowledge
God and his attributes, they deny a judgment to come.</p>

<p>(3) Next come the <i>Theists</i>. Among them should be
reckoned Socrates, who was the teacher of Plato as Plato
was of Aristotle. This latter drew up for his disciples the
rules of logic, organized the sciences, elucidated what was
formerly obscure, and expounded what had not been understood.
This school refuted the systems of the two others,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Materialists and Naturalists; but in exposing their
mistaken and perverse beliefs, they made use of arguments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
which they should not. "God suffices to protect the faithful
in war" (Koran, xxxiii. 25).</p>

<p>Aristotle also contended with success against the theories
of Plato, Socrates, and the theists who had preceded him,
and separated himself entirely from them; but he could not
eliminate from his doctrine the stains of infidelity and heresy
which disfigure the teaching of his predecessors. We should
therefore consider them all as unbelievers, as well as the so-called
Mussulman philosophers, such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna)
and Farabi, who have adopted their systems.</p>

<p>Let us, however, acknowledge that among Mussulman
philosophers none has better interpreted the doctrine of
Aristotle than the latter. What others have handed down
as his teaching is full of error, confusion, and obscurity
adapted to disconcert the reader. The unintelligible can
neither be accepted nor rejected. The philosophy of Aristotle,
all serious knowledge of which we owe to the translation
of these two learned men, may be divided into three
portions: the first contains matter justly chargeable with
impiety, the second is tainted with heresy, and the third
we are obliged to reject absolutely. We proceed to details:</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Divisions of the Philosophic Sciences</i></p>

<p>These sciences, in relation to the aim we have set before
us, may be divided into six sections: (1) Mathematics; (2)
Logic; (3) Physics; (4) Metaphysics; (5) Politics; (6)
Moral Philosophy.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Mathematics.</i> Mathematics comprises the knowledge
of calculation, geometry, and cosmography: it has no connection
with the religious sciences, and proves nothing for or
against religion; it rests on a foundation of proofs which, once
known and understood, can not be refuted. Mathematics
tend, however, to produce two bad results.</p>

<p>The first is this: Whoever studies this science admires the
subtlety and clearness of its proofs. His confidence in
philosophy increases, and he thinks that all its departments
are capable of the same clearness and solidity of proof as
mathematics. But when he hears people speak of the un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>belief
and impiety of mathematicians, of their professed disregard
for the Divine Law, which is notorious, it is true that,
out of regard for authority, he echoes these accusations, but
he says to himself at the same time that, if there was truth in
religion, it would not have escaped those who have displayed
so much keenness of intellect in the study of mathematics.</p>

<p>Next, when he becomes aware of the unbelief and rejection
of religion on the part of these learned men, he concludes
that to reject religion is reasonable. How many of such
men gone astray I have met whose sole argument was that
just mentioned. And supposing one puts to them the following
objection: "It does not follow that a man who excels
in one branch of knowledge excels in all others, nor that he
should be equally versed in jurisprudence, theology, and medicine.
It is possible to be entirely ignorant of metaphysics,
and yet to be an excellent grammarian. There are past masters
in every science who are entirely ignorant of other
branches of knowledge. The arguments of the ancient philosophers
are rigidly demonstrative in mathematics and only
conjectural in religious questions. In order to ascertain
this one must proceed to a thorough examination of the matter."
Supposing, I say, one makes the above objection to
these "apes of unbelief," they find it distasteful. Falling
a prey to their passions, to a besotted vanity, and the wish
to pass for learned men, they persist in maintaining the pre-eminence
of mathematicians in all branches of knowledge.
This is a serious evil, and for this reason those who study
mathematics should be checked from going too far in their
researches. For though far removed as it may be from the
things of religion, this study, serving as it does as an introduction
to the philosophic systems, casts over religion its
malign influence. It is rarely that a man devotes himself
to it without robbing himself of his faith and casting off the
restraints of religion.</p>

<p>The second evil comes from the sincere but ignorant Mussulman
who thinks the best way to defend religion is by
rejecting all the exact sciences. Accusing their professors of
being astray, he rejects their theories of the eclipses of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
sun and moon, and condemns them in the name of religion.
These accusations are carried far and wide, they reach the
ears of the philosopher who knows that these theories rest on
infallible proofs; far from losing confidence in them, he
believes, on the contrary, that Islam has ignorance and the
denial of scientific proofs for its basis, and his devotion to
philosophy increases with his hatred to religion.</p>

<p>It is therefore a great injury to religion to suppose that
the defense of Islam involves the condemnation of the exact
sciences. The religious law contains nothing which approves
them or condemns them, and in their turn they make no
attack on religion. The words of the Prophet, "The sun and
the moon are two signs of the power of God; they are not
eclipsed for the birth or the death of any one; when you
see these signs take refuge in prayer and invoke the name of
God"—these words, I say, do not in any way condemn the
astronomical calculations which define the orbits of these two
bodies, their conjunction and opposition according to particular
laws. But as for the so-called tradition, "When God
reveals himself in anything, he abases himself thereto," it
is unauthentic, and not found in any trustworthy collection
of the traditions.</p>

<p>Such is the bearing and the possible danger of mathematics.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Logic.</i> This science, in the same manner, contains
nothing for or against religion. Its object is the study of
different kinds of proofs and syllogisms, the conditions which
should hold between the premises of a proposition, the way
to combine them, the rules of a good definition, and the art of
formulating it. For knowledge consists of conceptions which
spring from a definition or of convictions which arise from
proofs. There is therefore nothing censurable in this science,
and it is laid under contribution by theologians as well as by
philosophers. The only difference is that the latter use a
particular set of technical formulæ and that they push their
divisions and subdivisions further.</p>

<p>It may be asked, What, then, this has to do with the grave
questions of religion, and on what ground opposition should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
be offered to the methods of logic? The objector, it will
be said, can only inspire the logician with an unfavorable
opinion of the intelligence and faith of his adversary, since
the latter's faith seems to be based upon such objections.
But, it must be admitted, logic <i>is</i> liable to abuse. Logicians
demand in reasoning certain conditions which lead to absolute
certainty, but when they touch on religious questions
they can no longer postulate these conditions, and ought therefore
to relax their habitual rigor. It happens, accordingly,
that a student who is enamored of the evidential methods of
logic, hearing his teachers accused of irreligion, believes that
this irreligion reposes on proofs as strong as those of logic,
and immediately, without attempting the study of metaphysics,
shares their mistake. This is a serious disadvantage
arising from the study of logic.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Physics.</i> The object of this science is the study of
the bodies which compose the universe: the sky and the stars,
and, here below, simple elements such as air, earth, water,
fire, and compound bodies—animals, plants, and minerals;
the reasons of their changes, developments, and intermixture.
By the nature of its researches it is closely connected with the
study of medicine, the object of which is the human body,
its principal and secondary organs, and the law which governs
their changes. Religion having no fault to find with
medical science, can not justly do so with physical, except on
some special, matters which we have mentioned in the work
entitled, "The Destruction of the Philosophers." Besides
these primary questions, there are some subordinate ones
depending on them, on which physical science is open to objection.
But all physical science rests, as we believe, on the
following principle: Nature is entirely subject to God; incapable
of acting by itself, it is an instrument in the hand of
the Creator; sun, moon, stars, and elements are subject to
God and can produce nothing of themselves. In a word,
nothing in nature can act spontaneously and apart from
God.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Metaphysics.</i> This is the fruitful breeding-ground of
the errors of philosophers. Here they can no longer satisfy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the laws of rigorous argumentation such as logic demands,
and this is what explains the disputes which arise between
them in the study of metaphysics. The system most closely
akin to the system of the Mohammedan doctors is that of
Aristotle as expounded to us by Farabi and Avicenna. The
sum total of their errors can be reduced to twenty propositions:
three of them are irreligious, and the other seventeen
heretical. It was in order to combat their system that we
wrote the work, "Destruction of the Philosophers." The
three propositions in which they are opposed to all the doctrines
of Islam are the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Bodies do not rise again; spirits alone will be rewarded
or punished; future punishments will be therefore spiritual
and not physical. They are right in admitting spiritual punishments,
for there will be such; but they are wrong in rejecting
physical punishments, and contradicting in this manner
the assertions of the Divine Law.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) "God takes cognizance of universals, not of specials."
This is manifestly irreligious. The Koran asserts truly,
"Not an atom's weight in heaven or earth can escape his
knowledge" (x. 62).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) They maintain that the universe exists from all eternity
and will never end.</p>

<p>None of these propositions has ever been admitted by
Moslems.</p>

<p>Besides this, they deny that God has attributes, and maintain
that he knows by his essence only and not by means of
any attribute accessory to his essence. In this point they
approach the doctrine of the Mutazilites, doctrines which we
are not obliged to condemn as irreligious. On the contrary,
in our work entitled, "Criteria of the Differences
Which Divide Islam from Atheism," we have proved the
wrongness of those who accuse of irreligion everything which
is opposed to their way of looking at things.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Political Science.</i> The professors of this confine
themselves to drawing up the rules which regulate temporal
matters and the royal power. They have borrowed their
theories on this point from the books which God has revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
to his prophets and from the sentences of ancient sages, gathered
by tradition.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Moral Philosophy.</i> The professors of this occupy
themselves with defining the attributes and qualities of the
soul, grouping them according to genus and species, and
pointing out the way to moderate and control them. They
have borrowed this system from the Sufis. These devout
men, who are always engaged in invoking the name of God,
in combating concupiscence and following the way of God
by renouncing the pleasures of this world, have received,
while in a state of ecstasy, revelations regarding the qualities
of the soul, its defects and its evil inclinations. These
revelations they have published, and the philosophers making
use of them have introduced them into their own systems
in order to embellish and give currency to their falsehoods.
In the times of the philosophers, as at every other period,
there existed some of these fervent mystics. God does not
deprive this world of them, for they are its sustainers, and
they draw down to it the blessings of heaven according to
the tradition: "It is by them that you obtain rain; it is by
them that you receive your subsistence." Such were "the
Companions of the Cave," who lived in ancient times, as
related by the Koran (xviii.). Now this mixture of moral
and philosophic doctrine with the words of the Prophet and
those of the Sufis gives rise to two dangers, one for the
upholder of those doctrines, the other for their opponent.</p>

<p>The danger for their opponent is serious. A narrow-minded
man, finding in their writings moral philosophy
mixed with unsupported theories, believes that he ought to
entirely reject them and to condemn those who profess them.
Having only heard them from their mouth he does not hesitate
in his ignorance to declare them false because those who
teach them are in error. It is as if some one was to reject
the profession of faith made by Christians, "There is only
one God and Jesus is his prophet," simply because it proceeds
from Christians and without inquiring whether it is the
profession of this creed or the denial of Mohammed's prophetic
mission which makes Christians infidels. Now, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
they are only infidels because of their rejection of our Prophet,
we are not entitled to reject those of their doctrines which do
not wear the stamp of infidelity. In a word, truth does not
cease to be true because it is found among them. Such, however,
is the tendency of weak minds: they judge the truth
according to its professors instead of judging its professors
by the standard of the truth. But a liberal spirit will take
as its guide this maxim of the prince of believers, Ali the son
of Abu Talib: "Do not seek for the truth by means of men;
find first the truth and then you will recognize those who follow
it." This is the procedure followed by a wise man.
Once in possession of the truth he examines the basis of various
doctrines which come before him, and when he has found
them true, he accepts them without troubling himself whether
the person who teaches them is sincere or a deceiver. Much
rather, remembering how gold is buried in the bowels of the
earth, he endeavors to disengage the truth from the mass of
errors in which it is engulfed. The skilled coin-assayer
plunges without hesitation his hand into the purse of the
coiner of false money, and relying on experience, separates
good coins from bad. It is the ignorant rustic, and not the
experienced assayer, who will ask why we should have anything
to do with a false coiner. The unskilled swimmer must
be kept away from the seashore, not the expert in diving. The
child, not the charmer, must be forbidden to handle serpents.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, men have such a good opinion of themselves,
of their mental superiority and intellectual depth; they
believe themselves so skilled in discerning the true from the
false, the path of safety from those of error, that they should
be forbidden as much as possible the perusal of philosophic
writings, for though they sometimes escape the danger just
pointed out, they can not avoid that which we are about to
indicate.</p>

<p>Some of the maxims found in my works regarding the
mysteries of religion have met with objectors of an inferior
rank in science, whose intellectual penetration is insufficient
to fathom such depths. They assert that these maxims are
borrowed from the ancient philosophers, whereas the truth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
that they are the fruit of my own meditations, but as the
proverb says, "Sandal follows the impress of sandal."<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Some of them are found in our books of religious law, but the
greater part are derived from the writings of the Sufis.</p>

<p>But even if they were borrowed exclusively from the doctrines
of the philosophers, is it right to reject an opinion when
it is reasonable in itself, supported by solid proofs, and contradicting
neither the Koran nor the traditions? If we adopt
this method and reject every truth which has chanced to have
been proclaimed by an impostor, how many truths we should
have to reject! How many verses of the Koran and traditions
of the prophets and Sufi discourses and maxims of sages
we must close our ears to because the author of the "Treatise
of the Brothers of Purity" has inserted them in his writings
in order to further his cause, and in order to lead minds
gradually astray in the paths of error! The consequence of
this procedure would be that impostors would snatch truths
out of our hands in order to embellish their own works. The
wise man, at least, should not make common cause with the
bigot blinded by ignorance.</p>

<p>Honey does not become impure because it may happen to
have been placed in the glass which the surgeon uses for cupping
purposes. The impurity of blood is due, not to its contact
with this glass, but to a peculiarity inherent in its own
nature; this peculiarity, not existing in honey, can not be communicated
to it by its being placed in the cupping-glass; it is
therefore wrong to regard it as impure. Such is, however,
the whimsical way of looking at things found in nearly all
men. Every word proceeding from an authority which they
approve is accepted by them, even were it false; every word
proceeding from one whom they suspect is rejected, even were
it true. In every case they judge of the truth according to its
professors and not of men according to the truth which they
profess, a <i>ne plus ultra</i> of error. Such is the peril in which
philosophy involves its opponents.</p>

<p>The second danger threatens those who accept the opinions
of the philosophers. When, for instance, we read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> "Treatise
of the Brothers of Purity," and other works of the same
kind, we find in them sentences spoken by the Prophet and
quotations from the Sufis. We approve these works; we give
them our confidence; and we finish by accepting the errors
which they contain, because of the good opinion of them with
which they have inspired us at the outset. Thus, by insensible
degrees, we are led astray. In view of this danger the
reading of philosophic writings so full of vain and delusive
utopias should be forbidden, just as the slippery banks of a
river are forbidden to one who knows not how to swim. The
perusal of these false teachings must be prevented just as one
prevents children from touching serpents. A snake-charmer
himself will abstain from touching snakes in the presence of
his young child, because he knows that the child, believing
himself as clever as his father, will not fail to imitate him;
and in order to lend more weight to his prohibition the
charmer will not touch a serpent under the eyes of his son.</p>

<p>Such should be the conduct of a learned man who is also
wise. But the snake-charmer, after having taken the serpent
and separated the venom from the antidote, having put the
latter on one side and destroyed the venom, ought not to withhold
the antidote from those who need it. In the same way
the skilled coin-assayer, after having put his hand in the bag
of the false coiner, taken out the good coins and thrown away
the bad ones, ought not to refuse the good to those who need
and ask for it. Such should be the conduct of the learned
man. If the patient feels a certain dislike of the antidote
because he knows that it is taken from a snake whose body is
the receptacle of poison, he should be disabused of this fallacy.</p>

<p>If a beggar hesitates to take a piece of gold which he knows
comes from the purse of a false coiner, he should be told that
his hesitation is a pure mistake which would deprive him of
the advantage which he seeks. It should be proved to him
that the contact of the good coins with the bad does not injure
the former and does not improve the latter. In the same way
the contact of truth with falsehood does not change truth into
falsehood, any more than it changes falsehood into truth.</p>

<p>Thus much, then, we have to say regarding the inconve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>niences
and dangers which spring from the study of philosophy.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>Sufism</i></p>

<p>When I had finished my examination of these doctrines I
applied myself to the study of Sufism. I saw that in order to
understand it thoroughly one must combine theory with practise.
The aim which the Sufis set before them is as follows:
To free the soul from the tyrannical yoke of the passions, to
deliver it from its wrong inclinations and evil instincts, in
order that in the purified heart there should only remain room
for God and for the invocation of his holy name.</p>

<p>As it was more easy to learn their doctrine than to practise
it, I studied first of all those of their books which contain it:
"The Nourishment of Hearts," by Abu Talib of Mecca, the
works of Hareth el Muhasibi, and the fragments which still
remain of Junaid, Shibli, Abu Yezid Bustami, and other
leaders (whose souls may God sanctify). I acquired a thorough
knowledge of their researches, and I learned all that was
possible to learn of their methods by study and oral teaching.
It became clear to me that the last stage could not be reached
by mere instruction, but only by transport, ecstasy, and the
transformation of the moral being.</p>

<p>To define health and satiety, to penetrate their causes and
conditions, is quite another thing from being well and satisfied.
To define drunkenness, to know that it is caused by vapors
which rise from the stomach and cloud the seat of intelligence,
is quite a different thing to being drunk. The drunken
man has no idea of the nature of drunkenness, just because he
is drunk and not in a condition to understand anything, while
the doctor, not being under the influence of drunkenness,
knows its character and laws. Or if the doctor fall ill, he has
a theoretical knowledge of the health of which he is deprived.</p>

<p>In the same way there is a considerable difference between
knowing renouncement, comprehending its conditions and
causes, and practising renouncement and detachment from the
things of this world. I saw that Sufism consists in experiences
rather than in definitions, and that what I was lacking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
belonged to the domain, not of instruction, but of ecstasy and
initiation.</p>

<p>The researches to which I had devoted myself, the path
which I had traversed in studying religious and speculative
branches of knowledge, had given me a firm faith in three
things—God, Inspiration, and the Last Judgment. These
three fundamental articles of belief were confirmed in me, not
merely by definite arguments, but by a chain of causes, circumstances,
and proofs which it is impossible to recount. I
saw that one can only hope for salvation by devotion and the
conquest of one's passions, a procedure which presupposes renouncement
and detachment from this world of falsehood in
order to turn toward eternity and meditation on God.
Finally, I saw that the only condition of success was to sacrifice
honors and riches and to sever the ties and attachments
of worldly life.</p>

<p>Coming seriously to consider my state, I found myself
bound down on all sides by these trammels. Examining my
actions, the most fair-seeming of which were my lecturing and
professorial occupations, I found to my surprise that I was engrossed
in several studies of little value, and profitless as regards
my salvation. I probed the motives of my teaching and
found that, in place of being sincerely consecrated to God, it
was only actuated by a vain desire of honor and reputation.
I perceived that I was on the edge of an abyss, and that without
an immediate conversion I should be doomed to eternal
fire. In these reflections I spent a long time. Still a prey
to uncertainty, one day I decided to leave Bagdad and to give
up everything; the next day I gave up my resolution. I advanced
one step and immediately relapsed. In the morning I
was sincerely resolved only to occupy myself with the future
life; in the evening a crowd of carnal thoughts assailed and
dispersed my resolutions. On the one side the world kept me
bound to my post in the chains of covetousness, on the other
side the voice of religion cried to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> "Up! Up! Thy life
is nearing its end, and thou hast a long journey to make. All
thy pretended knowledge is naught but falsehood and fantasy.
If thou dost not think now of thy salvation, when wilt thou
think of it? If thou dost not break thy chains to-day, when
wilt thou break them?" Then my resolve was strengthened,
I wished to give up all and flee; but the Tempter, returning to
the attack, said, "You are suffering from a transitory feeling;
don't give way to it, for it will soon pass. If you obey
it, if you give up this fine position, this honorable post exempt
from trouble and rivalry, this seat of authority safe from
attack, you will regret it later on without being able to recover
it."</p>

<p>Thus I remained, torn asunder by the opposite forces of
earthly passions and religious aspirations, for about six
months from the month Rajab of the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1096. At the
close of them my will yielded and I gave myself up to destiny.
God caused an impediment to chain my tongue and prevented
me from lecturing. Vainly I desired, in the interest of my
pupils, to go on with my teaching, but my mouth became
dumb. The silence to which I was condemned cast me into a
violent despair; my stomach became weak; I lost all appetite;
I could neither swallow a morsel of bread nor drink a drop of
water.</p>

<p>The enfeeblement of my physical powers was such that the
doctors, despairing of saving me, said, "The mischief is in the
heart, and has communicated itself to the whole organism;
there is no hope unless the cause of his grievous sadness be
arrested."</p>

<p>Finally, conscious of my weakness and the prostration of
my soul, I took refuge in God as a man at the end of himself
and without resources. "He who hears the wretched when
they cry" (Koran, xxvii. 63) deigned to hear me; He made
easy to me the sacrifice of honors, wealth, and family. I gave
out publicly that I intended to make the pilgrimage to Mecca,
while I secretly resolved to go to Syria, not wishing that the
Caliph (may God magnify him) or my friends should know
my intention of settling in that country. I made all kinds of
clever excuses for leaving Bagdad with the fixed intention of
not returning thither. The Imams of Irak criticized me with
one accord. Not one of them could admit that this sacrifice
had a religious motive, because they considered my position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
as the highest attainable in the religious community. "Behold
how far their knowledge goes!" (Koran, liii. 31). All
kinds of explanations of my conduct were forthcoming.
Those who were outside the limits of Irak attributed it to the
fear with which the Government inspired me. Those who
were on the spot and saw how the authorities wished to detain
me, their displeasure at my resolution and my refusal of
their request, said to themselves, "It is a calamity which
one can only impute to a fate which has befallen the Faithful
and Learning!"</p>

<p>At last I left Bagdad, giving up all my fortune. Only, as
lands and property in Irak can afford an endowment for pious
purposes, I obtained a legal authorization to preserve as much
as was necessary for my support and that of my children; for
there is surely nothing more lawful in the world than that a
learned man should provide sufficient to support his family.
I then betook myself to Syria, where I remained for two years,
which I devoted to retirement, meditation, and devout exercises.
I only thought of self-improvement and discipline and
of purification of the heart by prayer in going through the
forms of devotion which the Sufis had taught me. I used to
live a solitary life in the Mosque of Damascus, and was in the
habit of spending my days on the minaret after closing the
door behind me.</p>

<p>From thence I proceeded to Jerusalem, and every day secluded
myself in the Sanctuary of the Rock.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> After that I
felt a desire to accomplish the pilgrimage, and to receive a full
effusion of grace by visiting Mecca, Medina, and the tomb
of the Prophet. After visiting the shrine of the Friend of
God (Abraham), I went to the Hedjaz. Finally, the longings
of my heart and the prayers of my children brought me back
to my country, although I was so firmly resolved at first never
to revisit it. At any rate I meant, if I did return, to live
there solitary and in religious meditation; but events, family
cares, and vicissitudes of life changed my resolutions and
troubled my meditative calm. However irregular the intervals
which I could give to devotional ecstasy, my confidence in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
it did not diminish; and the more I was diverted by hindrances,
the more steadfastly I returned to it.</p>

<p>Ten years passed in this manner. During my successive
periods of meditation there were revealed to me things impossible
to recount. All that I shall say for the edification of
the reader is this: I learned from a sure source that the
Sufis are the true pioneers on the path of God; that there is
nothing more beautiful than their life, nor more praiseworthy
than their rule of conduct, nor purer than their morality.
The intelligence of thinkers, the wisdom of philosophers, the
knowledge of the most learned doctors of the law would in
vain combine their efforts in order to modify or improve their
doctrine and morals; it would be impossible. With the Sufis,
repose and movement, exterior or interior, are illumined with
the light which proceeds from the Central Radiance of Inspiration.
And what other light could shine on the face of
the earth? In a word, what can one criticize in them?
To purge the heart of all that does not belong to God
is the first step in their cathartic method. The drawing
up of the heart by prayer is the key-stone of it, as the cry
"<i>Allahu Akbar</i>" (God is great) is the key-stone of prayer,
and the last stage is the being lost in God. I say the last
stage, with reference to what may be reached by an effort of
will; but, to tell the truth, it is only the first stage in the life
of contemplation, the vestibule by which the initiated enter.</p>

<p>From the time that they set out on this path, revelations
commence for them. They come to see in the waking state
angels and souls of prophets; they hear their voices and wise
counsels. By means of this contemplation of heavenly forms
and images they rise by degrees to heights which human language
can not reach, which one can not even indicate without
falling into great and inevitable errors. The degree of proximity
to Deity which they attain is regarded by some as intermixture
of being (<i>haloul</i>), by others as identification
(<i>ittihad</i>), by others as intimate union (<i>wasl</i>). But all these
expressions are wrong, as we have explained in our work entitled,
"The Chief Aim." Those who have reached that
stage should confine themselves to repeating the verse—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">What I experience I shall not try to say;</div>
  <div class="verse">Call me happy, but ask me no more.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In short, he who does not arrive at the intuition of these truths
by means of ecstasy, knows only the <i>name</i> of inspiration. The
miracles wrought by the saints are, in fact, merely the earliest
forms of prophetic manifestation. Such was the state of the
Apostle of God, when, before receiving his commission, he
retired to Mount Hira to give himself up to such intensity of
prayer and meditation that the Arabs said: "Mohammed is
become enamored of God."</p>

<p>This state, then, can be revealed to the initiated in ecstasy,
and to him who is incapable of ecstasy, by obedience and attention,
on condition that he frequents the society of Sufis till
he arrives, so to speak, at an imitative initiation. Such is
the faith which one can obtain by remaining among them, and
intercourse with them is never painful.</p>

<p>But even when we are deprived of the advantage of their
society, we can comprehend the possibility of this state
(revelation by means of ecstasy) by a chain of manifest
proofs. We have explained this in the treatise entitled
"Marvels of the Heart," which forms part of our work, "The
Revival of the Religious Sciences." The certitude derived
from proofs is called "knowledge"; passing into the state we
describe is called "transport"; believing the experience of
others and oral transmission is "faith." Such are the three
degrees of knowledge, as it is written, "The Lord will raise
to different ranks those among you who have believed and
those who have received knowledge from him" (Koran, lviii.
12).</p>

<p>But behind those who believe comes a crowd of ignorant
people who deny the reality of Sufism, hear discourses on it
with incredulous irony, and treat as charlatans those who profess
it. To this ignorant crowd the verse applies:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> "There
are those among them who come to listen to thee, and when
they leave thee, ask of those who have received knowledge,
'What has he just said?' These are they whose hearts God
has sealed up with blindness and who only follow their
passions."
Among the number of convictions which I owe to the practise
of the Sufi rule is the knowledge of the true nature of inspiration.
This knowledge is of such great importance that
I proceed to expound it in detail.</p>


<p class="heading"><i>The Reality of Inspiration: Its Importance for the
Human Race</i></p>

<p>The substance of man at the moment of its creation is a simple
monad, devoid of knowledge of the worlds subject to the
Creator, worlds whose infinite number is only known to him,
as the Koran says: "Only thy Lord knoweth the number of
his armies."</p>

<p>Man arrives at this knowledge by the aid of his perceptions;
each of his senses is given him that he may comprehend the
world of created things, and by the term "world" we understand
the different species of creatures. The first sense revealed
to man is touch, by means of which he perceives a certain
group of qualities—heat, cold, moist, dry. The sense
of touch does not perceive colors and forms, which are for
it as though they did not exist. Next comes the sense of sight,
which makes him acquainted with colors and forms; that is
to say, with that which occupies the highest rank in the world
of sensation. The sense of hearing succeeds, and then the
senses of smell and taste.</p>

<p>When the human being can elevate himself above the world
of sense, toward the age of seven, he receives the faculty of discrimination;
he enters then upon a new phase of existence and
can experience, thanks to this faculty, impressions, superior
to those of the senses, which do not occur in the sphere of
sensation.</p>

<p>He then passes to another phase and receives reason, by
which he discerns things necessary, possible, and impossible;
in a word, all the notions which he could not combine in the
former stages of his existence. But beyond reason and at a
higher level by a new faculty of vision is bestowed upon him,
by which he perceives invisible things, the secrets of the future
and other concepts as inaccessible to reason as the concepts
of reason are inaccessible to mere discrimination and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
what is perceived by discrimination to the senses. Just as
the man possessed only of discrimination rejects and denies
the notions acquired by reason, so do certain rationalists reject
and deny the notion of inspiration. It is a proof of their
profound ignorance; for, instead of argument, they merely
deny inspiration as a sphere unknown and possessing no real
existence. In the same way, a man blind from birth, who
knows neither by experience nor by information what colors
and forms are, neither knows nor understands them when
some one speaks of them to him for the first time.</p>

<p>God, wishing to render intelligible to men the idea of inspiration,
has given them a kind of glimpse of it in sleep. In
fact, man perceives while asleep the things of the invisible
world either clearly manifest or under the veil of allegory to
be subsequently lifted by divination. If, however, one was
to say to a person who had never himself experienced these
dreams that, in a state of lethargy resembling death and during
the complete suspension of sight, hearing, and all the
senses, a man can see the things of the invisible world, this
person would exclaim, and seek to prove the impossibility of
these visions by some such argument as the following: "The
sensitive faculties are the causes of perception. Now, if one
can perceive certain things when one is in full possession of
these faculties, how much more is their perception impossible
when these faculties are suspended."</p>

<p>The falsity of such an argument is shown by evidence and
experience. For in the same way as reason constitutes a particular
phase of existence in which intellectual concepts are
perceived which are hidden from the senses, similarly, inspiration
is a special state in which the inner eye discovers,
revealed by a celestial light, mysteries out of the reach of reason.
The doubts which are raised regarding inspiration relate
(1) to its possibility, (2) to its real and actual existence,
(3) to its manifestation in this or that person.</p>

<p>To prove the possibility of inspiration is to prove that it belongs
to a category of branches of knowledge which can not be
attained by reason. It is the same with medical science and
astronomy. He who studies them is obliged to recognize that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
they are derived solely from the revelation and special grace
of God. Some astronomical phenomena only occur once in a
thousand years; how then can we know them by experience?</p>

<p>We may say the same of inspiration, which is one of the
branches of intuitional knowledge. Further, the perception
of things which are beyond the attainment of reason is only
one of the features peculiar to inspiration, which possesses a
great number of others. The characteristic which we have
mentioned is only, as it were, a drop of water in the ocean, and
we have mentioned it because people experience what is analogous
to it in dreams and in the sciences of medicine and astronomy.
These branches of knowledge belong to the domain
of prophetic miracles, and reason can not attain to them.</p>

<p>As to the other characteristics of inspiration, they are only
revealed to adepts in Sufism and in a state of ecstatic transport.
The little that we know of the nature of inspiration we
owe to the kind of likeness to it which we find in sleep;
without that we should be incapable of comprehending it, and
consequently of believing in it, for conviction results from
comprehension. The process of initiation into Sufism exhibits
this likeness to inspiration from the first. There is in
it a kind of ecstasy proportioned to the condition of the person
initiated, and a degree of certitude and conviction which
can not be attained by reason. This single fact is sufficient
to make us believe in inspiration.</p>

<p>We now come to deal with doubts relative to the inspiration
of a particular prophet. We shall not arrive at certitude
on this point except by ascertaining, either by ocular evidence
or by reliable tradition, the facts relating to that prophet.
When we have ascertained the real nature of inspiration and
proceed to the serious study of the Koran and the traditions,
we shall then know certainly that Mohammed is the greatest of
prophets. After that we should fortify our conviction by
verifying the truth of his preaching and the salutary effect
which it has upon the soul. We should verify in experience
the truth of sentences such as the following: "He who
makes his conduct accord with his knowledge receives from
God more knowledge"; or this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> "God delivers to the oppressor
him who favors injustice"; or again, "Whosoever
when rising in the morning has only one anxiety (to please
God), God will preserve him from all anxiety in this world
and the next."</p>

<p>When we have verified these sayings in experience thousands
of times, we shall be in possession of a certitude on
which doubt can obtain no hold. Such is the path we must
traverse in order to realize the truth of inspiration. It is not
a question of finding out whether a rod has been changed into
a serpent, or whether the moon has been split in two.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> If we
regard miracles in isolation, without their countless attendant
circumstances, we shall be liable to confound them with magic
and falsehood, or to regard them as a means of leading men
astray, as it is written, "God misleads and directs as he
chooses" (Koran, xxxv. 9); we shall find ourselves involved
in all the difficulties which the question of miracles raises.
If, for instance, we believe that eloquence of style is a proof of
inspiration, it is possible that an eloquent style composed with
this object may inspire us with a false belief in the inspiration
of him who wields it. The supernatural should be only one
of the constituents which go to form our belief, without our
placing too much reliance on this or that detail. We should
rather resemble a person who, learning a fact from a group of
people, can not point to this or that particular man as his informant,
and who, not distinguishing between them, can not
explain precisely how his conviction regarding the fact has
been formed.</p>

<p>Such are the characteristics of scientific certitude. As to
the transport which permits men to see the truth and, so to
speak, to handle it, it is only known to the Sufis. What I
have just said regarding the true nature of inspiration is sufficient
for the aim which I have proposed to myself. I may
return to the subject later, if necessary.</p>

<p>I pass now to the causes of the decay of faith and show the
means of bringing back those who have erred and of preserving
them from the dangers which threaten them. To those
who doubt because they are tinctured with the doctrine of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Ta'limites, my treatise entitled, "The Just Balance," affords
a sufficient guide; therefore it is unnecessary to return to the
subject here.</p>

<p>As to the vain theories of the Ibahat, I have grouped them
in seven classes, and explained them in the work entitled,
"Alchemy of Happiness." For those whose faith has been
undermined by philosophy, so far that they deny the reality of
inspiration, we have proved the truth and necessity of it, seeking
our proofs in the hidden properties of medicines and of
the heavenly bodies. It is for them that we have written this
treatise, and the reason for our seeking for proofs in the sciences
of medicine and of astronomy is because these sciences
belong to the domain of philosophy. All those branches of
knowledge which our opponents boast of—astronomy, medicine,
physics, and divination—provide us with arguments in
favor of the Prophet.</p>

<p>As to those who, professing a lip-faith in the Prophet,
adulterate religion with philosophy, they really deny inspiration,
since in their view the Prophet is only a sage whom a
superior destiny has appointed as guide to men, and this view
belies the true nature of inspiration. To believe in the
Prophet is to admit that there is above intelligence a sphere in
which are revealed to the inner vision truths beyond the grasp
of intelligence, just as things seen are not apprehended by the
sense of hearing, nor things understood by that of touch. If
our opponent denies the existence of such a higher region, we
can prove to him, not only its possibility, but its actuality.
If, on the contrary, he admits its existence, he recognizes at
the same time that there are in that sphere things which reason
can not grasp; nay, which reason rejects as false and absurd.
Suppose, for instance, that the fact of dreams occurring
in sleep were not so common and notorious as it is, our
wise men would not fail to repudiate the assertion that the
secrets of the invisible world can be revealed while the senses
are, so to speak, suspended.</p>

<p>Again, if it were to be said to one of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> "Is it possible
that there is in the world a thing as small as a grain, which
being carried into a city can destroy it and afterward destroy
itself so that nothing remains either of the city or of itself?"
"Certainly," he would exclaim, "it is impossible and ridiculous."
Such, however, is the effect of fire, which would certainly
be disputed by one who had not witnessed it with his
own eyes. Now, the refusal to believe in the mysteries of the
other life is of the same kind.</p>

<p>As to the fourth cause of the spread of unbelief—the decay
of faith owing to the bad example set by learned men—there
are three ways of checking it.</p>

<p>(1) One can answer thus: "The learned man whom you
accuse of disobeying the divine law knows that he disobeys, as
you do when you drink wine or exact usury or allow yourself
in evil-speaking, lying, and slander. You know your sin and
yield to it, not through ignorance, but because you are mastered
by concupiscence. The same is the case with the
learned man. How many believe in doctors who do not abstain
from fruit and cold water when strictly forbidden them
by a doctor! That does not prove that those things are not
dangerous, or that their faith in the doctor was not solidly
established. Similar errors on the part of learned men are
to be imputed solely to their weakness."</p>

<p>(2) Or again, one may say to a simple and ignorant man:
"The learned man reckons upon his knowledge as a viaticum
for the next life. He believes that his knowledge will save
him and plead in his favor, and that his intellectual superiority
will entitle him to indulgence; lastly, that if his
knowledge increases his responsibility, it may also entitle
him to a higher degree of consideration. All that is possible;
and even if the learned man has neglected practise, he can at
any rate produce proofs of his knowledge. But you, poor,
witless one, if, like him, you neglect practise, destitute as you
are of knowledge, you will perish without anything to plead
in your favor."</p>

<p>(3) Or one may answer, and this reason is the true one:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
"The truly learned man only sins through carelessness, and
does not remain in a state of impenitence. For real knowledge
shows sin to be a deadly poison, and the other world to
be superior to this. Convinced of this truth, man ought not
to exchange the precious for the vile. But the knowledge of
which we speak is not derived from sources accessible to human
diligence, and that is why progress in mere worldly
knowledge renders the sinner more hardened in his revolt
against God."</p>

<p>True knowledge, on the contrary, inspires in him who is
initiate in it more fear and more reverence, and raises a
barrier of defense between him and sin. He may slip and
stumble, it is true, as is inevitable with one encompassed by
human infirmity, but these slips and stumbles will not weaken
his faith. The true Moslem succumbs occasionally to temptation,
but he repents and will not persevere obstinately in the
path of error.</p>

<p>I pray God the Omnipotent to place us in the ranks of his
chosen, among the number of those whom he directs in the
path of safety, in whom he inspires fervor lest they forget
him; whom he cleanses from all defilement, that nothing may
remain in them except himself; yea, of those whom he indwells
completely, that they may adore none beside him.</p>

<h4>ZAMAKHSHARI'S COMMENTARY ON THE KORAN</h4>


<h5>PREFACE</h5>

<p class="heading">IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD, KIND AND PITYING</p>

<p>Praise to God, who has sent from heaven the Koran, in the
form of an address of which the words are coherent and arranged
in order, and who has sent it in continuous chapters
according to the demands of necessity; who has willed that it
should begin by expressing the praise due to God, and end
by recounting his power and protection; who has included in
it two kinds of revelations, the one obscure, the other perfectly
clear; who has divided the Koran into Suras, and the Suras
into verses, and has distinguished the different parts by divisions
and conclusions: qualifications which apply only to
that which has been created, and produced without a model,
and could only be the attributes of things which have had a
beginning and recognize an author of whom they are the work.
Praise to him who has reserved to himself alone the privilege
of priority and eternity, and who has given to everything save
himself the characteristic of having been created.</p>

<p>Praise to him who has created the Koran, the sense of which
is a light to guide the spirit, the demonstrations of which are
clear; like an inspiration which blazons forth its proof and
authentic title; like a lecture written in the Arabic language,
and free from all faults, which is the key to open the treasures
of all spiritual and temporal blessings, and which confirms
and witnesses the truth of all the Holy Books which have
preceded it; like a miracle which, alone among all miracles,
has existed during all the passage of the centuries, and a book
which, alone among all books, will be repeated in every language
and in every place.</p>

<p>By this book, he has shut the mouths of the most nobly born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Arabs, in that they are challenged to produce something to be
compared with it, he has rendered mute the most eloquent
orators in that he has defied them to imitate it. Amongst
those who possess the greatest command of the language in all
its purity, no one has the enterprise to compose anything
which equals it, or even approaches it. No one of those who
are distinguished for their eloquence has dared to compete
with him in a single chapter equal to the shortest Sura included
in the Koran. Yet the orators of the land are more
numerous than the pebbles of the Batha valley and more plentiful
than the grains of sand in the desert of Dahna. The
blood of patriotism has not boiled in their veins, and zeal for
the honor of their cause has not moved them to the undertaking,
although they are known to be naturally inclined to disputes
and quarrels, and ready to embrace with ardor and
without moderation every opportunity for rivalry and hostility;
although when roused to fight for the defense of their
reputation, they are quick to face the gravest dangers, and
will plunge themselves into every excess to obtain the object
of their desires. If any one opposes their title to glory or
prevails against them, they oppose him in great numbers; if
any one in their hearing boasts of a glorious deed, they respond
with a multitude of glorious deeds.</p>

<p>God has employed against them two kinds of weapons, first
the written law, then the sword; but they have not challenged
him to combat nor attempted to cope with the sword, although
the drawn sword is no more than a trifling weapon, fitted only
for badinage, if the strength of authentic truth is not joined
to the victorious point. Certainly, if they have in no way
put up even a semblance of resistance to the truth which has
been presented to them, it is simply because they know well
that the sea, released from its boundaries, would envelop and
overflow any mere well made by human hands; and the sun,
by the brightness of its fire, eclipses the light of all the stars.</p>

<p>May the favors of God shine on the most worthy of those
who have received revelations, on the friend of God, Abu'l-Kasem
Mohammed, son of Abd-Allah, son of Abd-Almotalleb,
son of Haschem, whose standard is raised amongst the de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>scendants
of Lowaiy; who has been fortified by constant protection
and assisted by wisdom, whose visage radiates glory,
and who shines with all the signs of nobility; on the illustrious
Prophet whose name has been inscribed in the Law and the
Gospel! May blessings fall also upon his sainted descendants,
on those successors to his authority who have with him
the ties which are born of marriage!</p>

<p>It is well known that, in the profundities of science and
the principles of the arts, there is little difference between
the learned of different classes. Those who practise the various
arts are equal, or nearly equal. If one professor outdistances
another, it is only by a few steps; and if one artist
outstrips another, it is only by a short distance. But where
one sees a true difference among the classes, where they make
every effort to surpass each other, where there is true emulation
and rivalry, there one finds real inferiors and superiors,
of the sort that there is among those who pursue the same
career from incomprehensible distances, distances so great
that one alone balances a thousand others. There are, in the
sciences as in the arts, the beauties of certain delicate points;
there are subtle thoughts which arouse the wisdom of reflective
spirits, profound, hidden secrets covered with veils which
very few men, even among those of the most distinguished
talent, can lift, secrets which can only be discovered and
brought to light by those who among men of merit are like the
pearl placed in the center of the necklace, and like the stone
which is set in the gold of the ring. Ordinary men have not
the eyes to create such excellences, and are as though chained
to their seats by a servile desire to imitate, and can not even
flatter themselves that any one will trim the hair from
their foreheads<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and give them freedom.</p>

<p>Of all the sciences, that which abounds in the most difficulties,
which demands the greatest effort in spirit, which offers
the largest number of problems capable of fatiguing the
strongest intellect, I mean those extraordinary subtleties from
which it is difficult to extricate oneself, which are locked as if
in vaults, whose thread is cut and difficult to regain—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
science is the interpreting of the Koran. It is a science for
which, as has been said by Djahed in his work entitled,
"Composition of the Koran," no savants are fitted, and to
which they devote their lives without hope of complete
success.</p>

<p>I have often noticed that my confrères in religion, men
who hold the foremost rank among the disciples of the true
faith and law, men exceptionally proficient in the knowledge
of the language of the Arabs and in the fundamental dogmas
of religion, have been enthusiastic in expressing their satisfaction
and admiration every time that, consulted by them for
the interpretation of some passage of the Koran, I have explained
their difficulty and disclosed to them the truth which
was hidden from them. They expressed a keen desire for
me to write a work treating on the subject in all its phases.
At last they joined in begging me to dictate to them a commentary
which should unveil all the mysteries of the Holy
Book, and help them to understand the different explanations
and opinions. I excused myself from doing as they desired,
but they continually renewed their pleading; and, to conquer
my resistance, they employed the mediation of the chief religious
men, and the most learned among those who professed
doctrines of justice and unity. I realized that it was obligatory
upon me to defer to their desires, so that I came to consider
such a work as a personal duty and task; but that which
finally brought me to consent was that I saw our age to be in
a state of decay, and the men of our time to be degenerating.
I realized that far from being able to raise themselves to
worthy heights in the two sciences of thought and exposition,
they were not even capable of attaining to those weaker means
which serve as instruments in the interpretation of the Koran.
I therefore resolved to write this book that it might be for
them The Discoverer of Truth.</p>

THE MAXIMS OF ZAMAKHSHAHI</small></h4>


<h5>I</h5>

<p>When you go to the mosque, walk with reverence; and when
you pray, fill your heart with humility. Think of the power
of the glorious King, and do not forget what is written concerning
the temptations of the devil. Consider before what
all-powerful sovereign you kneel, and what deceitful enemy
you have to combat. Verily, no one can maintain himself on
a firm foundation in this difficult world, except it be the man
who is loyal to noble principles and fortified by his profession
of faith; the faithful who sighs in fear of chastisement, contrite,
repentant, eager in the pursuit of reward, who spurs
his horse into the arena of obedience, and disciplines his spirit
in the practise of submission.</p>


<h5>II</h5>

<p>Did I say to you that our country is destined to mourning?
That will become true when an unjust sovereign rules.
Tyranny is heavier than the horse's hoofs, more destructive
than the unchained torrents, more deadly than the poisoned
winds of Yemen, more devastating than the plague. Tyranny
prevents prayers rising to heaven and prevents the
blessings of heaven from falling upon the earth. Flee far
from the abode of this menace, even if you are one of the
highest nobles of the land, the most illustrious because of your
wealth and your children. Fear lest the birds of ruin fatten
on the land, and earthquakes or lightnings destroy its inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>


<h5>III</h5>

<p>Do not pride yourself on the nobility of your birth, for
that belongs to your father; join to your hereditary virtues
those which you have acquired recently. By this union you
will be truly noble. Do not feel elated over the nobility of
your father, if you can not draw pride from that which is in
yourself; for the glory of your ancestors is vain if you have
not a personal glory. There is the same difference between
the fame of your ancestors and your own fame that there is
between your food of yesterday and of to-day; for the feast
that has passed can not calm the hunger of to-day, and still
less can it provide for the days which follow.</p>

<p class="half-title">THE "ASSEMBLIES" OF AL HARIRI</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> work of Al Hariri may well stand as our best example
of typical Arab prose. With regard to religious
writing, a few thoughtful Mohammedans, as we have
seen, might travel, and seek new light, and meditate profoundly;
but the great mass of the people were merely blindly
fanatic. Mohammed was the prophet of God, and any one
who failed to shout this with the rest of the world, was to be
killed. Popular interest went but little further. But when
you turned to the art of stringing words together, every true
Arab was immediately attentive. There was an Arab proverb
that God had given genius, or true creative ability, to
three things, the brain of the Frank, the hand of the Chinaman,
and the tongue of the Arab.</p>

<p>To our own more sober literary sense the clever twists of
phrase and sound in which these people took such pride, seem
but the outer garment of thought, more apt to confuse than
to reveal its deeper meaning. Yet what the Arabs admire,
they admire; and they find it to perfection in Al Hariri's
"Assemblies." No mere translation can convey its intricacies
of sound and sense. Only such an artistic word-juggler
as Al Hariri himself could convey the impression of the original.
And Al Hariri himself labored long on each brief "Assembly,"
polishing and repolishing, before he submitted each
tale to the judgment of his keenly critical listeners.</p>

<p>The name "Assemblies" he gave to his work because each
tale pictures an assembly of people. The form is highly artificial,
for, while the author represents himself as accidentally
stumbling upon each assembly, yet each proves ultimately
to consist of a gathering of people listening with admiration
to the brilliant words and clever rascalities of the
same old beggar, Abu Zayd. The trick played by Abu Zayd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
is usually slight, the chief interest from the Arab view-point
depending on the beggar's witty words and especially upon
his supposedly extemporaneous verse.</p>

<p>Neither should the reader pass unnoticed the moral side of
Hariri's work. He quite definitely thinks of himself as a
teacher, and studies to make each "Assembly" a worthy
guide to righteousness. His "Assemblies" number fifty in
all, but the earlier ones are generally accepted as the best, the
eleventh and twelfth being particularly noted for their excellence,
after which the collection seems slightly to decline.</p>

<p>Of course Al Hariri was by no means alone in composing
this sort of tale. Similar "Assemblies" had preceded his;
many more were to follow. In short we touch here upon the
"popular literature" of the Arabs, the collection of short
stories which were to blossom into the "Arabian Nights"—though
in the later tales of this character we find less of verse
and more of story, in short less of the Arab and more of the
increasing Persian influence.</p>

<h4>PREFACE</h4>

<p class="heading">IN THE NAME OF GOD THE MERCIFUL, MOST MERCIFUL</p>

<p>Thus saith the excellent, the incomparable, Abu Mohammed
al Kasim ibn 'Ali ibn Mohammed ibn 'Othman Al Hariri of
Basrah (God cool his resting-place).</p>

<p>O God, we praise thee for what perspicuity thou hast
taught, and what enunciation thou hast inspired; as we praise
thee for what bounty thou hast enlarged, what mercy thou
hast diffused: And we take refuge with thee from the vehemence
of fluency and the immoderation of talkativeness, as
we take refuge with thee from the vice of inarticulateness and
the shame of hesitation. And by thee we seek to be kept from
temptation through the flattery of the praiser and the
connivance of the favor, as we seek to be kept from
exposure to the defaming of the slanderer and the betrayal of
the informer. And we ask pardon of thee if our desires carry
us into the region of ambiguities, as we ask pardon if our
steps advance to the domain of errors. And we ask of thee
succor which shall lead us aright, and a heart turning with
justice, and a tongue adorned with truth, and a speech
strengthened with demonstration, and accuracy that shall keep
us from mistake, and resolution that shall conquer caprice,
and perception by which we may estimate duly: And that
thou wilt help us by thy guidance to conceive, and enable us
by thy assistance to express; that thou wilt guard us from
error in narration, and turn us from unseemliness in jesting;
that we may be secure from slanders of the tongue; that we
may be free from the ill of tinseled speech; that we walk not
in the road of sin, nor stand in the place of repentance; that
we be not pursued by suit or censure, nor need to flee from
hastiness to excuse. O God, fulfil to us this wish; give us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
attain to this desire: put us not forth of thy large shadow,
make us not a morsel for the devourer. For now we stretch
forth to thee the hand of entreaty; we are thorough in humiliation
to thee and abasement. And we call down thy
abundant grace and thy bounty that is over all, with humbleness
of seeking and with the venture of hope. Also approaching
thee through the merits of Mohammed, lord of men, the
intercessor whose intercession shall be received at the congregation
of judgment. By whom thou hast set the seal
to the prophets, and whose degree thou hast exalted to the
highest heaven; whom thou hast described in thy clear-speaking
Book, and hast said (and thou art the most truthful of
sayers): "It is the word of a noble envoy, of him who is
mighty in the presence of the Lord of the throne, having
authority, obeyed, yea, faithful." O God, send thy
blessing on him and his house who guide aright, and his companions
who built up the faith; and make us followers of his
guidance and theirs, and profit us all by the loving of him and
them: for thou art Almighty, and one meet to answer prayer.</p>

<p>And now: In a meeting devoted to that learning whose
breeze has stilled in this age, whose lights are nigh gone out,
there ran a mention of the Assemblies which had been invented
by Badi'az Zeman, the sage of Hamadan (God show
him mercy); in which he had referred the composition to
Abu'l Fath of Alexandria and the relation of 'Isa, son of
Hisham. And both these are persons obscure, not known;
vague, not to be recognized. Then suggested to me one whose
suggestion is as a decree, and obedience to whom is as a
prize, that I should compose Assemblies, following in them
the method of Badi' (although the lame steed attains not to
outrun like the stout one). Then I reminded him of what
is said concerning him who joins even two words, or strings
together one or two verses: and deprecated this position in
which the understanding is bewildered, and the fancy misses
aim, and the depth of the intelligence is probed, and a man's
real value is made manifest: and in which one is forced to
be as a wood-gatherer by night, or as he who musters footmen
and horsemen together: considering, too, that the voluble man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
is seldom secure or pardoned if he trips. But when he consented
not to forbearance, and freed me not from his demand,
I assented to his invitation with the assenting of the obedient,
and displayed in according with him all my endeavor; and
composed, in spite of what I suffered from frozen genius, and
dimmed intelligence, and failing judgment, and afflicting
cares, fifty Assemblies, comprising what is serious in language
and lively, what is delicate in expression and dignified;
the brilliancies of eloquence and its pearls, and beauties of
scholarship and its rarities: besides what I have adorned
them with of verses of the Koran and goodly metonymies, and
studded them with of Arab proverbs, and scholarly elegancies,
and grammatical riddles, and decisions dependent on the
meaning of words, and original addresses, and ornate orations,
and tear-moving exhortations, and amusing jests: all of which
I have indited as by the tongue of Abu Zayd of Seruj, while
I have attributed the relating of them to Al Harith, son of
Hammam, of Basra. And whenever I change the pasture I
have no purpose but to inspirit the reader, and to increase the
number of those who shall seek my book. And of the poetry
of others I have introduced nothing but two single verses,
on which I have based the fabric of the Assembly of Holwan;
and two others, in a couplet, which I have inserted at
the conclusion of the Assembly of Kerej. And, as for the
rest, my own mind is the father of its virginity, the author
of its sweet and its bitter. Yet I acknowledge withal that
Badi' (God show him mercy) is a mighty passer of goals, a
worker of wonders; and that he who essays after him to the
composition of an Assembly, even though he be gifted with
the eloquence of Kodameh, does but scoop up of his overflow,
and travels that path only by his guidance. And excellently
said one:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>If before it mourned, I had mourned my love for Su'da, then should
I have healed my soul, nor had afterward to repent.</p>

<p>But it mourned before me, and its mourning excited mine, and I
said, "The superiority is to the one that is first."</p></div>

<p>Now I hope I shall not be, in respect of the playful style
that I display, and the source that I repair to, like the beast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
that scratched up its death with its hoof, or he who cut off
his nose with his own hand; so as to be joined to those who
are "most of all losers in their works, whose course on earth
has been in vain, while they count that they have done fair
deeds." Since I know that although he who is intelligent and
liberal will connive at me, and he who is friendly and partial
may defend me, I can hardly escape from the simpleton who
is ignorant, or the spiteful man who feigns ignorance; who
will detract from me on account of this composition, and
will give out that it is among the things forbidden of the law.
But yet, whoever scans matters with the eye of intelligence,
and makes good his insight into principles, will rank these
Assemblies in the order of useful writings, and class them
with the fables that relate to brutes and lifeless objects. Now
none was ever heard of whose hearing shrank from such tales,
or who held as sinful those who related them at ordinary
times. Moreover, since deeds depend on intentions, and in
these lies the effectiveness of religious obligations, what fault
is there in one who composes stories for instruction, not for
display, and whose purpose in them is the education and not
the fablings? Nay, is he not in the position of one who
assents to doctrine, and "guides to the right path"?</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Yet am I content if I may carry my caprice, and then be quit of it,
without any debt against me or to me.</p></div>

<p>And of God I seek to be helped in what I purpose, and to
be kept from that which makes defective, and to be led to
that which leads aright. For there is no refuge but to him,
and no seeking of succor but in him, and no prospering but
from him, and no sanctuary but he. On him I rely, and to
him I have recourse.</p>

<h4><a name="THE_FIRST_ASSEMBLY" id="THE_FIRST_ASSEMBLY"></a>THE FIRST ASSEMBLY<br />
<small>(CALLED "OF SAN'A")</small><a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></h4>


<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: When I mounted the
hump of exile, and misery removed me from my fellows, the
shocks of the time cast me to San'a of Yemen. And I entered
it with wallets empty, manifest in my need; I had not a
meal; I found not in my sack a mouthful. Then began I to
traverse its ways like one crazed, and to roam in its depths
as roams the thirsting bird. And wherever ranged my
glances, wherever ran my goings at morn or even, I sought
some generous man before whom I might fray the tissue of
my countenance, to whom I might be open concerning my
need; or one well bred, whose aspect might dispel my pain,
whose anecdote might relieve my thirsting. Until the close
of my circuit brought me, and the overture of courtesy guided
me, to a wide place of concourse, in which was a throng and
a wailing. Then I entered the thicket of the crowd to explore
what was drawing forth tears. And I saw in the middle
of the ring a person slender of make; upon him was the equipment
of pilgrimage, and he had the voice of lamentation.
And he was studding cadences with the jewels of his wording,
and striking hearings with the reproofs of his admonition.
And now the medley of the crowds had surrounded him, as
the halo surrounds the moon, or the shell the fruit. So I
crept toward him, that I might catch of his profitable sayings,
and gather up of his gems. And I heard him say, as he
coursed along in his career, and the throat of his improvisation
made utterance:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>O thou reckless in petulance, trailing the garment of vanity!
O thou headstrong in follies, turning aside to idle
tales! How long wilt thou persevere in thine error, and eat
sweetly of the pasture of thy wrong? How far wilt thou be
extreme in thy pride, and not abstain from thy wantonness?
Thou provokest by thy rebellion the Master of thy forelock;
in the foulness of thy behaving thou goest boldly against the
Knower of thy secret. Thou hidest thyself from thy neighbor,
but thou art in the sight of thy Watcher; thou concealest
from thy slave, but no hidden thing is hidden from thy Ruler.
Thinkest thou that thy state will profit thee when thy departure
draweth near? or that thy wealth will deliver thee
when thy deeds destroy thee? or that thy repentance will
suffice for thee when thy foot slippeth? or that thy kindred
will lean to thee in the day that thy judgment-place gathereth
thee? How is it thou hast not walked in the high-road of
guidance, and hastened the treatment of thy disease, and
blunted the edge of thine iniquity, and restrained thyself—thy
chief enemy? Is not death thy doom? What then is
thy preparation? Is not gray hair thy warning? What then
is thy excuse? And in the grave's niche thy sleeping-place?
What dost thou say? And to God thy going? and who shall
be thy defender? Oft hath the time awakened thee, but
thou hast set thyself to slumber; and admonition hath drawn
thee, but thou hast strained against it; and warnings have
been manifest to thee, but thou hast made thyself blind;
and truth hath been established to thee, but thou hast disputed
it; and death hath bid thee remember, but thou hast
sought to forget; and it hath been in thy power to impart of
good, but thou hast not imparted. Thou preferrest money
which thou mayest hoard before piety which thou mayest
keep in mind: thou choosest a castle thou mayest rear rather
than bounty thou mayest confer. Thou inclinest from the
guide from whom thou mightest get guidance, to the pelf thou
mayest gain as a gift; thou lettest the love of the raiment thou
covetest overcome the recompense thou mightest earn. The
rubies of gifts cling to thy heart more than the seasons of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
prayer; and the heightening of dowries is preferred with thee
to continuance in almsgivings. The dishes of many meats
are more desired to thee than the leaves of doctrines; the
jesting of comrades is more cheerful to thee than the reading
of the Koran. Thou commandest to righteousness, but
violatest its sanctuary; thou forbiddest from deceit, but refrainest
not thyself: thou turnest men from oppression, and
then thou drawest near to it; thou fearest mankind, but God
is more worthy that thou shouldest fear him. Then he recited:</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Woe to him who seeks the world, and turns to it his careering:</div>
  <div class="verse">And recovers not from his greediness for it, and the excess of his love.</div>
  <div class="verse">Oh, if he were wise, but a drop of what he seeks would content him.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he laid his dust, and let his spittle subside; and put
his bottle on his arm, and his staff under his armpit. And
when the company gazed on his uprising, and saw that he
equipped himself to move away from the midst, each of them
put his hand into his bosom, and filled for him a bucket from
his stream: and said, "Use this for thy spending, or divide
it among thy friends." And he received it with half-closed
eyes, and turned away from them, giving thanks; and began
to take leave of whoever would escort him, that his road
might be hidden from them; and to dismiss whoever would
follow him, that his dwelling might be unknown. Said Al
Harith, son of Hammam: Now I went after him, concealing
from him my person; and followed on his track from
where he could not see me; until he came to a cave, and slipped
into it suddenly. So I waited for him till he put off his
sandals and washed his feet, and then I ran in upon him;
and found him sitting opposite an attendant, at some white
bread and a roast kid, and over against them was a jar of
date-wine. And I said to him, "Sirrah, was that thy story,
and is this thy reality? "But he puffed the puff of heat and
went near to burst with rage; and ceased not to stare at me
till I thought he would leap upon me. But when his fire was
allayed, and his flame hid itself, he recited:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">I don the black robe to seek my meal, and I fix my hook in the
hardest prey:</div>
 <div class="verse">And of my preaching I make a noose, and steal with it against the
chaser and the chased.</div>
 <div class="verse">Fortune has forced me to make way even to the lion of the thicket
by the subtlety of my beguiling.</div>
 <div class="verse">Yet do I not fear its change, nor does my loin quiver at it:</div>
 <div class="verse">Nor does a covetous mind lead me to water at any well that will
soil my honor.</div>
 <div class="verse">Now if Fortune were just in its decree it would not empower the
worthless with authority.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he said to me, "Come and eat; or, if thou wilt, rise
and tell." But I turned to his attendant, and said, "I conjure
thee, by him through whom harm is deprecated, that thou
tell me who is this." He said, "This is Abu Zayd, of Seruj,
the light of foreigners, the crown of the learned." Then I
turned back to whence I came, and was extreme in wonder at
what I saw.</p>


<h4>THE SECOND ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF HOLWAN")</small><a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: Ever since my amulets
were doffed and my turbans were donned, I was eager
to visit learning's seat and to jade to it the camels of seeking,
that through it I might cleave to what would be my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
ornament among men, my rain-cloud in thirst. And through
the excess of my longing to kindle at it, and my desire to
robe myself in its raiment, I discussed with every one, great
and small, and sought my draught both of the rain-flood and
the dew, and solaced myself with hope and desire. Now
when I descended at Holwan, and had already tried the
brethren, and tested their values, and proved what was worthless
or fine, I found there Abu Zayd of Seruj, shifting among
the varieties of pedigree, beating about in various courses of
gain-getting; for at one time he claimed to be of the race of
Sasan, and at another he made himself kin to the princes of
Ghassan; and now he sallied forth in the vesture of poets;
and anon he put on the pride of nobles. And yet with all
this diversifying of his condition, and this display of contradiction,
he is adorned with grace and information, and
courtesy and knowledge, and astonishing eloquence, and obedient
improvisation, and excelling accomplishments, and a
foot that mounts the hills of the sciences. Now, through his
goodly attainments he is associated with in spite of his
faults; and through the largeness of his information there is
a fondness for the sight of him; and through the blandishment
of his fair-speaking men are loath to oppose him; and
through the sweetness of his address he is helped to his desire.
Then I clung to his skirts for the sake of his peculiar accomplishments,
and valued highly his affection by reason of his
precious qualities.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">With him I wiped away my cares, and beheld my fortune displayed
to me, open of face, gleaming with light.</div>
 <div class="verse">I looked upon his nearness to me as kinship, his abiding as wealth,
his aspect as a full draught, his life as rain.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus we remained a long season; he produced for me daily
some pleasantness, and drove some doubt from my heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
until the hand of want mixed for him the cup of parting,
and the lack of a meal urged him to abandon Irak; and the
failures of supply cast him into desert regions, and the waving
of the banner of distress ranged him in the line of travelers;
and he sharpened for departure the edge of determination,
and journeyed away, drawing my heart with his leading
cord.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">After he was gone none pleased me who kept by me, none filled me
with affection by urging me to intimacy.</div>
 <div class="verse">Since he strayed away none has appeared to me his like in excellence;
no friend has gotten the equal of his qualities.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So he was hidden from me a season: I knew not his lair;
I found none to tell of him; but when I had returned from
my wandering to the place where my branch had sprouted,
I was once present in the town library, which is the council-hall
of scholars, the meeting-place of residents and strangers:
Then there entered one with a thick beard and a squalid
aspect, and he saluted those who sat, and took seat in the last
rows of the people. Then began he to produce what was
in his wallet, and to astonish those present by the sagacity
of his judgment. And he said to the man who was next
him, "What is the book into which thou lookest?" He
said, "The poems of Abu 'Obadeh; him of whose excellence
men bear witness." He said, "In what thou hast seen hast
thou hit on any fine thing which thou admirest?" He said,
"Yes; the line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">As though she smiled from strung pearls or hailstones, or camomile-flowers.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For it is original in the use of similitude which it contains."
He said to him, "Here is a wonder! here is a lack of taste,
Sir, thou hast taken for fat what is only swollen; thou hast
blown on that which is no fuel: where art thou in comparison
with the rare verse which unites the similitudes of
the teeth?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">My life a ransom for those teeth whose beauty charms, and which a
purity adorns sufficing thee for all other.</div>
 <div class="verse">She parts her lips from fresh pearls, and from hail-stones, and from
camomile-flowers, and from the palm-shoot, and from bubbles.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>Then each one approved the couplet and admired it, and
bade him repeat it and dictate it. And he was asked,
"Whose is this verse, and is its author living or dead?"
He said, "By Allah, right is most worthy to be followed,
and truth is most fitting to be listened to: Know, friends,
that it is his who talks with you to-day." Said Al Harith:
Now it was as though the company doubted of his fathering,
and were unwilling to give credit to his claim. And he
perceived what had fallen into their thoughts, and was aware
of their inward unbelief; and was afraid that blame might
chance to him, or ill-fame reach him; so he quoted from the
Koran, "Some suspicions are a sin." Then he said, "O
ye reciters of verse, physicians of sickly phrase!—Truly
the purity of the gem is shown by the testing, and the hand of
truth rends the cloak of doubt.—Now it was said aforetime
that by trial is a man honored or contemned. So come! I
now expose my hidden store to the proving, I offer my saddle-bag
for comparison." Then hastened one who was there
and said: "I know a verse such that there is no weaving on
its beam, such that no genius can supply one after its image.
Now, if thou wish to draw our hearts to thee, compose after
this style:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">She rained pearls from the daffodil, and watered the rose, and bit upon the <i>'unnab</i> with hail-stone.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And it was but the glance of an eye, or less, before he
recited rarely:</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">I asked her when she met me to put off her crimson veil, and to
endow my hearing with the sweetest of tidings:</div>

 <div class="verse">And she removed the ruddy light which covered the brightness of
her moon, and she dropped pearls from a perfumed ring.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then all present were astonished at his readiness, and
acknowledged his honesty. And when he perceived that
they approved his diction, and were hastening into the path
of honoring him, he looked down the twinkling of an eye;
then he said, "Here are two other verses for you"; and
recited:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">She came on the day when departure afflicted, in black robes, biting
her fingers like one regretful, confounded:</div>

 <div class="verse">And night lowered on her morn, and a branch supported them both,
and she bit into crystal with pearls.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then did the company set high his value, and deem that
his steady rain was a plenteous one; and they made pleasant
their converse with him, and gave him goodly clothing.
Said the teller of this story: Now when I saw the blazing
of his firebrand, and the gleam of his unveiled brightness,
I fixed a long look to guess at him, and made my eye to
stray over his countenance. And lo! he was our Shaykh
of Seruj; but now his dark night was moon-lit. Then I
congratulated myself on his coming thither, and hastened to
kiss his hand: and said to him, "What has changed thy
appearance, so that I could not recognize thee? what has
made thy beard gray, so that I knew not thy countenance?"
And he indited and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">The stroke of calamities makes us hoary, and fortune to men is a
changer.</div>
 <div class="verse">If it yields to-day to any, to-morrow it overcomes him.</div>
 <div class="verse">Trust not the gleam of its lightning, for it is a deceitful gleam.</div>
 <div class="verse">But be patient if it hounds calamities against thee, and drives them
on.</div>
 <div class="verse">For there is no disgrace on the pure gold when it is turned about
in the fire.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he rose and departed from his place, and carried
away our hearts with him.</p>


<h4>THE THIRD ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF KAYLAH")</small><a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I was set with some
comrades in a company wherein he that made appeal was
never bootless, and the rubbing of the fire-shafts never failed,
and the flame of contention never blazed. And while we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
were catching from each other the cues of recitations, and
betaking ourselves to novelties of anecdote, behold there
stood by us one on whom was a worn garment, and in whose
walk was a limp. And he said, O ye best of treasures, joys
of your kindred: Health to you this morning; may ye enjoy
your morning draught. Look on one who was erewhile
master of guest-room and largess, wealth and bounty, land
and villages, dishes and feasting. But the frowning of
calamities ceased not from him, and the warrings of sorrows,
and the fire-flakes of the malice of the envious, and the
succession of dark befallings, until the court was empty,
and the yard was bare, and the fountain sank, and the dwelling
was desolate, and the hall was void, and the chamber
stone-strewed. And fortune shifted so that the household
wailed; and the stalls were vacant, so that the rival had
compassion; and the cattle and the goods they perished, so
that the envious and malignant pitied. And to such a pass
did we come, through assailing fortune and prostrating
need, that we were shod with soreness, and fed on choking,
and filled our bellies with ache, and wrapped our entrails
upon hunger, and anointed our eyes with watching, and made
pits our home, and deemed thorns a smooth bed, and came
to forget our saddles, and thought destroying death to be
sweet, and the ordained day to be tardy. And now is there
any one generous to heal, bountiful to bestow? For by him
who made me to spring from Kaylah, surely I am now a
brother of penury, I have not a night's victual.</p>

<p>Said Al Harith, son of Hammam: Now I pitied his distresses,
and inclined to the eliciting of his rhymes. So I
drew forth for him a denar, and said to him, to prove him,
"If thou praise it in verse it is thine, full surely." And he
betook himself to recite on the spot, borrowing nothing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">How noble is that yellow one, whose yellowness is pure,</div>
  <div class="verse">Which traverses the regions, and whose journeying is afar.</div>
  <div class="verse">Told abroad are its fame and repute:</div>
  <div class="verse">Its lines are set as the secret sign of wealth;</div>
  <div class="verse">Its march is coupled with the success of endeavors;</div>
  <div class="verse">Its bright look is loved by mankind;</div>
  <div class="verse">As though its ore had been molten of their hearts.</div>
  <div class="verse">By its aid whoever has gotten it in his purse assails boldly,</div>
  <div class="verse">Though kindred be perished, or tardy to help.</div>
  <div class="verse">Oh charming are its purity and brightness;</div>
  <div class="verse">Charming are its sufficiency and help.</div>
  <div class="verse">How many a ruler is there whose rule has been perfected by it!</div>
  <div class="verse">How many a sumptuous one is there whose grief, but for it, would be endless!</div>
  <div class="verse">How many a host of cares has one charge of it put to flight!</div>
  <div class="verse">How many a full moon has a sum of it brought down!</div>
  <div class="verse">How many a one burning with rage, whose coal is flaming,</div>
  <div class="verse">Has it been secretly whispered to, and then his anger has softened.</div>
  <div class="verse">How many a prisoner, whom his kin had yielded,</div>
  <div class="verse">Has it delivered, so that his gladness has been unmingled,</div>
  <div class="verse">Now by the Truth of the Lord whose creation brought it forth,</div>
  <div class="verse">Were it not for his fear, I should say its power is supreme.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he stretched forth his hand after his recitation, and
said, "The honorable man performs what he promises, and
the rain-cloud pours if it has thundered." So I threw him
the denar, and said, "Take it; no grudging goes with it."
And he put it in his mouth and said, "God bless it." Then
he girt up his skirts for departure, after that he had paid
his thanks. But there arose in me, through his pleasantry,
a giddiness of desire which made me ready to incur indebtedness.
So I bared another denar, and said, "Does it
suit thee to blame this, and then gather it?" And he recited
impromptu, and sang with speed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ruin on it for a deceiver and insincere,</div>
  <div class="verse">The yellow one with two faces like a hypocrite!</div>
  <div class="verse">It shows forth with two qualities to the eye of him that looks on it,</div>
  <div class="verse">The adornment of the loved one, the color of the lover.</div>
  <div class="verse">Affection for it, think they who judge truly,</div>
  <div class="verse">Tempts men to commit that which shall anger their Maker.</div>
  <div class="verse">But for it no thief's right hand were cut off;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor would tyranny be displayed by the impious;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor would the niggard shrink from the night-farer;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor would the delayed claimant mourn the delay of him that withholds;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor would men call to God from the envious who casts at them.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
  <div class="verse">Moreover, the worst quality that it possesses</div>
  <div class="verse">Is that it helps thee not in straits,</div>
  <div class="verse">Save by fleeing from thee like a runaway slave.</div>
  <div class="verse">Well done he who casts it away from a hill-top,</div>
  <div class="verse">And who, when it whispers to him with the whispering of a lover,</div>
  <div class="verse">Says to it in the words of the truth-speaking, the veracious,</div>
  <div class="verse">"I have no mind for intimacy with thee—begone!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then said I to him, "How abundant is thy shower!" He
said, "Agreement binds strongest." So I tossed him the
second denar and said, "Consecrate them both with the
Twice-read Chapter." He cast it into his mouth and joined
it with its twin, and turned away blessing his morning's
walk, praising the assembly and its bounty. Said Al Harith,
son of Hammam: Now my heart whispered me that he
was Abu Zayd, and that his going lame was for a trick;
so I called him back and said to him, "Thou art recognized
by thy eloquence, so straighten thy walk." He said, "If
thou be the son of Hammam, be thou greeted with honor
and live long among the honorable." I said, "I am Harith;
but what is thy condition amid all thy fortunes." He
said, "I change between two conditions, distress and ease;
and I veer with two winds, the tempest and the breeze." I
said, "And how hast thou pretended lameness? the like of
thee plays not buffoon." Then his cheerfulness, which had
shone forth, waned; but he recited as he moved away:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I have feigned to be lame, not from love of lameness, but that I may
knock at the gate of relief.</div>

<div class="verse">For my cord is thrown on my neck, and I go as one who ranges
freely.</div>

<div class="verse">Now if men blame me I say, "Excuse me: sure there is no guilt on
the lame."</div>
</div></div></div>



<h4>THE FOURTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF DAMIETTA")</small><a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></h4>


<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I journeyed to
Damietta in a year of much coming and going, and in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
days was I glanced after for my affluence, desired in friendship:
I trained the bordered robes of wealth and looked
upon the features of joy. And I was traveling with companions
who had broken the staff of dissension, who were
suckled on the milk-flows of concord, so that they showed
like the teeth of a comb in uniformity, and like one soul in
agreement of desires; but we coursed on withal apace, and
not one of us but had saddled a fleet she-camel; and if we
alighted at a station or went aside to a spring, we snatched
the halt and lengthened not the staying.</p>

<p>Now it happened that we were urging our camels on a
night youthful in prime, raven-locked of complexion; and
we journeyed until the night-season had put off its prime,
and the morning had wiped away the dye of the dark; but
when we wearied of the march and inclined to drowsiness,
we came upon a ground with dew-moistened hillocks, and a
faint east breeze: and we chose it as a resting-place for the
white camels, an abode for the night-halt. Now when the
caravan had descended there, and the groan and the roar
of the beasts were still, I heard a loud-voiced man say to
his talk-fellow in the camp, "What is the rule of thy conduct
with thy people and neighbors?" The other answered,
I am duteous to my neighbor though he wrong me; and
give my fellowship even to the violent; and bear with a
partner though he disorder my affairs; and love my friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
even though he drench me with a tepid draught; and prefer
my well-wisher above my brother; and fulfil to my comrade
even though he requite me not with a tenth; and think
little of much if it be of my guest; and whelm my companion
with my kindness; and put my talk-fellow in the
place of my prince; and hold my intimate to be as my chief;
and commit my gifts to my acquaintance; and confer my
comforts on my associate; and soften my speech to him that
hates me; and continue to ask after him that disregards me;
and am pleased with but the crumbs of my due; and am
content with but the least portion of my reward; and complain
not of wrong even when I am wronged; and revenge
not, even though a viper sting me.</p>

<p>Then said his companion to him, Alas! my boy, only he
who clings should be clung to; only he who is valuable
should be prized. As for me I give only to him who will
requite; I distinguish not the insolent by my regard; nor
will I be of pure affection to one who refuses me fair-dealing;
nor treat as a brother one who would undo my
tethering-rope; nor aid one who would baulk my hopes; nor
care for one who would cut my cords; nor be courteous to
him who ignores my value; nor give my leading rope to
one who breaks my covenant; nor be free of my love to my
adversaries; nor lay aside my menace to the hostile; nor
plant my benefits on the land of my enemies; nor be willing
to impart to him who rejoices at my ills; nor show my
regard to him who will exult at my death; nor favor with
my gifts any but my friends; nor call to the curing of my
sickness any but those who love me; nor confer my friendship
on him who will not stop my breach; nor make my
purpose sincere to him who wishes my decease; nor be earnest
in prayer for him who will not fill my wallet; nor pour
out my praise on him who empties my jar. For who has
adjudged that I should be lavish and thou shouldest hoard,
that I should be soft and thou rough, that I should melt
and thou freeze, that I should blaze and thou smolder?
No, by Allah, but let us balance in speech as coin, and
match in deed as sandals, that each to each we may be safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
from fraud and free from hatred. For else, why should
I give thee full water and thou stint me? why should I
hear with thee and thou contemn me? why should I gain
for thee and thou wound me? why should I advance to thee
and thou repel me? For how should fair-dealing be attracted
by injury? how can the sun rise clear with cloud?
And when did love follow docilely after wrong? and what
man of honor consents to a state of abasement? For excellently
said thy father:</p>

<p>Said Al Harith, son of Hammam: Now, when I had gathered
what passed between them, I longed to know them in
person. And when the sun shone forth, and robed the sky
with light, I went forth before the camels had risen, and with
an earliness beyond the earliness of the crow, and began to
follow the direction of that night-voice, and to examine the
faces with a searching glance: until I caught sight of Abu
Zayd and his son talking together, and upon them were two
worn mantles. Then I knew that they were my two talkers
of the night, the authors of my recitation. So I approached
them as one enamored of their refinement, pitying their
shabbiness; and offered them a removal to my lodging, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the disposal of my much and my little; and began to tell
abroad their worth among the travelers, and to shake for
them the fruited branches; until they were whelmed with
gifts, and taken as friends. Now we were in a night-camp,
whence we could discern the build of the villages, and spy
the fires of hospitality. And when Abu Zayd saw that his
purse was full, and his distress removed, he said to me,
"Truly my body is dirty, and my filth has caked: Wilt
thou permit me to go to a village, and bathe, and fulfil this
urgent need?" I said, "If thou wilt; but quick! return!"
He said, "Thou shalt find me appear again to thee, quicker
than the glancing of thine eye." Then he coursed away, as
courses the good steed in the training-ground, and said to his
son, "Haste! haste!" And we imagined not that he was
deceiving, or seeking to escape. So we stayed and watched
for him as men watch for the new moons of feasts, and
made search for him by spies and scouts, until the sunlight
was weak with age, and the wasted bank of the day
had nigh crumbled in. Then, when the term of waiting
had been prolonged, and the sun showed in faded garb, I
said to my companions, "We have gone to the extreme in
delay, and have been long in the setting forth; so that we
have lost time, and it is plain that the man was lying.
Now, therefore, prepare for the journey, and turn not aside
to the greenness of dung-heaps." Then I rose to equip
my camel and lade for the departure; and found that Abu
Zayd had written on the pack-saddle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Oh thou, who wast to me an arm and a helper, above all mankind!</div>

  <div class="verse">Reckon not that I have left thee through impatience or ingratitude:</div>

  <div class="verse">For since I was born I have been of those who "when they have
eaten separate."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Said Al Harith: Then I made the company read the
words of the Koran that were on the pack-saddle, so that he
who had blamed him might excuse him. And they admired
his witticism, but commanded themselves from his mischief.
Then we set forth, nor could we learn whose company he had
gotten in our place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>


<h4>THE FIFTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF KUFA")</small><a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I was conversing at
Kufa, in a night whose complexion was of a two-fold hue,
whose moon was as an amulet of silver, with companions who
had been nourished on the milk of eloquence, who might
draw the train of oblivion over Sahban. Each was a man
to remember from, and not to guard against; each was one
whom his friend would incline to, and not avoid. And the
night talk fascinated us until the moon had set, and the
watching overcame us. Now when night's unmingled dark
had spread its awning, and there was naught but nodding
among us, we heard from the gate the faint sound of a wayfarer,
rousing the dogs; then followed the knock of one bidding
to open. We said, "Who is it that comes in the dark
night?" Then the traveler answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O people of the mansion, be ye guarded from ill!</div>
  <div class="verse">Meet not harm as long as ye live!</div>
  <div class="verse">Lo! the night which glooms has driven</div>
  <div class="verse">To your abode one disheveled, dust-laden,</div>
  <div class="verse">A brother of journeying, that has been lengthened, extended,</div>
  <div class="verse">Till he has become bent and yellow</div>
  <div class="verse">Like the new moon of the horizon when it smiles.</div>
  <div class="verse">And now he approaches your courtyard, begging boldly,</div>
  <div class="verse">And repairs to you before all people else,</div>
  <div class="verse">To seek from you food and a lodging.</div>
  <div class="verse">Ye have in him a guest contented, ingenuous,</div>
  <div class="verse">One pleased with all, whether sweet or bitter,</div>
  <div class="verse">One who will withdraw from you, publishing your bounty.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Said Al Harith, son of Hammam: Now when we were
caught by the sweetness of his utterance, and knew what
was behind his lightning, we hastened to open the gate, and
met him with welcome; and said to the boy "Quick, quick!
bring what is ready!" Then said our guest, "Now, by him
who has set me down at your abode, I will not roll my
tongue over your food, unless ye pledge me that ye will not
make me a burden, that ye will not, for my sake, task
yourselves with a meal. For sometimes a morsel aches the
eater, and forbids him his repasts. And the worst of guests
is he who imposes trouble and annoys his host, and especially
with a harm that affects the body and tends to sickness.
For, by that proverb, which is widely current, 'The best
Slippers are those that are clearly seen,' is only meant that
supper-time should be hastened, and eating by night, which
dims the sight, avoided. Unless, by Allah, the fire of hunger
kindle and stand in the way of sleep." Said Al Harith:
Now it was as though he had got sight of our desire, and so
had shot with the bow of our conviction. Accordingly we
gratified him by agreeing to the condition, and commended
him for his easy temper. And when the boy brought what
was to be had, and lighted the candle in the midst of us, I
looked close at him, and lo! it was Abu Zayd. So I said to
my company,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> "Joy to you of the guest who has come!
Nay, but the spoil is lightly won! For if the moon of Sirius
has gone down, truly the moon of poetry has risen: Or if
the full moon of the Lion has waned, the full moon of eloquence
shines forth." Then ran through them the wine-glow
of joy, and sleep flew away from their eye-corners.
And they refused the rest which they had purposed, and
returned to the spreading out of pleasantry, after they had
folded it. But Abu Zayd kept intent upon plying his
hands; however, when what was before him might be removed,
I said to him, "Present us with one of the rare
stories from thy night talkings, or some wonder from among
the wonders of thy journeys." He said, "Of wonders I
have met with such as no seers have seen, no tellers have
told. But among the most wondrous was that which I beheld
to-night, a little before my visit to you and my coming
to your gate." Then we bade him tell us of this new thing
which he had seen in the field of his night-faring. He said,
Truly the hurlings of exile have thrown me to this land:
And I was in hunger and distress, with a scrip like the heart
of the mother of Moses. Now, as soon as the dark had
settled, I arose, in spite of all my footsoreness, to seek a
host or to gain a loaf. Then the driver hunger, and Fate,
which is by-named the Father of Wonders, urged me on,
till I stood at the door of a house, and spoke, improvising:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Hail people of this dwelling,</div>
  <div class="verse">May ye live in the ease of a plenteous life!</div>
  <div class="verse">What have ye for a son of the road, one crushed to the sand,</div>
  <div class="verse">Worn with journeys, stumbling in the night-dark night,</div>
  <div class="verse">Aching in entrails, which enclose naught but hunger?</div>
  <div class="verse">For two days he has not tasted the savor of a meal:</div>
  <div class="verse">In your land there is no refuge for him.</div>
  <div class="verse">And already the van of the drooping darkness has gloomed;</div>
  <div class="verse">And through bewilderment he is in restlessness.</div>
  <div class="verse">Now in this abode is there any one, sweet of spring,</div>
  <div class="verse">Who will say to me, "Throw away thy staff and enter:</div>
  <div class="verse">Rejoice in a cheerful welcome and a ready meal?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then came forth to me a lad in a tunic, and answered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Now by the sanctity of the Shaykh who ordained hospitality,</div>
  <div class="verse">And founded the House of Pilgrimage in the Mother of cities,</div>
  <div class="verse">We have naught for the night-farer when he visits us</div>
  <div class="verse">But conversation and a lodging in our hall.</div>
  <div class="verse">For how should he entertain whom hinders from sleepfulness</div>
  <div class="verse">Hunger which peels his bones when it assails him?</div>
  <div class="verse">Now what thinkest thou of my tale? what thinkest thou?</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>
<p>I said, "What shall I do with an empty house, and a
host the ally of penury? But tell me, youth, what is thy
name, for thy understanding has charmed me." He said,
"My name is Zayd, and my birth-place Fayd: and I came
to this city yesterday with my mother's kindred of the Benu
'Abs." I said to him, "Show me further, so mayest thou
live and be raised when thou fallest!" He said, "My
mother Barrah told me (and she is like her name, 'pious')
that she married in the year of the foray on Mawan a man
of the nobles of Seruj and Ghassan; but when he was aware
of her pregnancy (for he was a crafty bird, it is said) he
made off from her by stealth, and away he has stayed, nor
is it known whether he is alive and to be looked for, or
whether he has been laid in the lonely tomb." Said Abu
Zayd, "Now I knew by sure signs that he was my child;
but the emptiness of my hand turned me from making known
to him, so I parted from him with heart crushed and tears
unsealed. And now, ye men of understanding, have ye
heard aught more wondrous than this wonder?" We said,
"No, by him who has knowledge of the Book." He said,
"Record it among the wonders of chance; bid it abide forever
in the hearts of scrolls; for nothing like it has been
told abroad in the world." Then he bade bring the ink-flask,
and its snake-like reeds, and we wrote the story elegantly
as he worded it; after which we sought to draw from
him his wish about receiving his boy. He said, "If my
purse were heavy, then to take charge of my son would be
light." We said, "If a <i>nisab</i> of money would suffice thee,
we will collect it for thee at once." He said, "And how
should a <i>nisab</i> not content me? would any but a madman
despise such a sum?" Said the narrator, Then each of
us undertook a share of it, and wrote for him an order for
it. Whereupon he gave thanks for the kindness, and exhausted
the plenteousness of praise; until we thought his
speech long, or our merit little. And then he spread out
such a bright mantle of talk as might shame the stuffs of
Yemen, until the dawn appeared and the light-bearing morn
went forth. So we spent a night of which the mixed hues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
had departed, until its hind-locks grew gray in the dawn;
and whose lucky stars were sovereign until its branch budded
into light. But when the limb of the sun peeped forth, he
leaped up as leaps the gazelle, and said, "Rise up, that we
may take hold on the gifts and draw payment of the checks:
for the clefts of my heart are widening through yearning
after my child." So I went with him, hand in hand, to
make easy his success. But as soon as he had secured the
coin in his purse the marks of his joy flashed forth, and he
said, "Be thou rewarded for the steps of thy feet! be God
my substitute toward thee!" I said, "I wish to follow
thee that I may behold thy noble child, and speak with him
that he may answer eloquently." Then looked he at me
as looks the deceiver on the deceived, and laughed till his
eyeballs gushed with tears; and he recited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O thou who didst fancy the mirage to be water when I quoted to
thee what I quoted!</div>

 <div class="verse">I thought not that my guile would be hidden, or that it would be
doubtful what I meant.</div>

 <div class="verse">By Allah, I have no Barrah for a spouse; I have no son from whom
to take a by-name.</div>

 <div class="verse">Nothing is mine but divers kinds of magic, in which I am original
and copy no one:</div>

 <div class="verse">They are such as Al Asma'i tells not of in what he has told; such
as Al Komayt never wove.</div>

 <div class="verse">These I use when I will to reach whatever my hand would pluck:</div>

 <div class="verse">And were I to abandon them, changed would be my state, nor should
I gain what I now gain.</div>

 <div class="verse">So allow my excuse; nay, pardon me, if I have done wrong or crime.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he took leave of me and passed away, and set coals
of the <i>ghada</i> in my breast.</p>



<h4>THE SIXTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF MERAGHAH," OR "THE DIVERSIFIED")</small><a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></h4>


<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I was present in the
Court of Supervision at Meraghah when the talk ran of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
eloquence. Then agreed all who were there of the knights
of the pen, and the lords of genius, that there remained no
one who could select his diction, or use himself freely in it
as he willed: and that since the men of old were gone, there
was none now left who could originate a brilliant method,
or open a virgin style. And that even one marvelous among
the writers of this age, and holding in his grasp the cords
of eloquence, is but a dependent on the ancients, even though
he possess the fluency of Sahban Wa'il. Now there was in
the assembly an elderly man, sitting on the outskirts, in
the places of the attendants: and as often as the company
overran in their career, and scattered fruit, good and bad,
from their store, the side-glance of his eye and the up-turning
of his nose showed that he was one silent to spring, one
crouching who would extend his stride: that he was a twanger
of the bow who shapes his arrows, one who sits in wait desiring
the conflict. But when the quivers were empty, and
quiet returned; when the storms had fallen, and the dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>puter
was stayed, he turned to the company and said, Ye
have uttered a grievous thing; ye have wandered much from
the way: for ye have magnified moldering bones; ye have
been excessive in your leaning to those who are gone; ye
have contemned your generation, among whom ye were born,
and with whom your friendships are established. Have ye
forgotten, ye skilful in testing, ye sages of loosing and
binding, how much new springs have given forth; how the
colt has surpassed the full-grown steed; in refined expressions,
and delightful metaphors, and ornate addresses,
and admired cadences? And, if any one here will look diligently,
is there in the ancients aught but ideas whose paths
are worn, whose ranges are restricted; which have been
handed down from them through the priority of their birth,
not from any superiority in him who draws first at the well
over him who comes after? Now truly know I one who,
when he composes, colors richly; and when he expresses,
embellishes; and when he is lengthy, finds golden thoughts;
and when he is brief, baffles his imitator; and when he improvises,
astonishes; and when he creates, cuts the envious.</p>

<p>Then said to him the President of the Court, the Eye of
those Eyes: "Who is it that strikes on this rock, that is the
hero of these qualities?" He said, "It is the adversary of
this thy skirmish, the partner of thy disputation: Now, if
thou wilt, rein a good steed, call forth one who will answer,
so shalt thou see a wonder." He said to him, "Stranger,
the chough in our land is not taken for an eagle, and with
us it is easy to discern between silver and shingle. Rare is
he who exposes himself to the conflict, and then escapes the
mortal hurt; or who stirs up the dust of trial, and then
catches not the mote of contempt. So offer not thy honor
to shame, turn not from the counsel of the counselor." He
answered, "Each man knows best the mark of his arrow,
and be sure the night shall disclose its morn."</p>

<p>Then whispered the company as to how his well should
be fathomed, and his proving undertaken. Said one of
them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> "Leave him to my share, that I may pelt him with the
stone of my story; for it is the tightest of knots, the touchstone
of testing." Then they invested him with the command
in this business as the Rebels invested Abu Na'ameh.
Whereupon he turned to the elder and said, Know that I
am attached to this Governor and maintain my condition
by ornamental eloquence. Now, in my country, I could
rely for the straightening of my crookedness on the sufficiency
of my means, coupled with the smallness of my family.
But when my back was weighted, and my thin rain
failed, I repaired to him from my home with hope, and
besought him to restore my comeliness and my competence.
And he looked pleasantly on my coming, and was gracious,
and served me morn and even. But when I sought permission
from him to depart to my abode, on the shoulder
of cheerfulness, he said, "I have determined that I will
not provide thee with supplies, I will bring together for
thee no scattered means, unless, before thy departure, thou
compose an address, setting in it an exposition of thy state;
such, that the letters of one of every two words shall all
have dots, while the letters of the other shall not be pointed
at all." And now have I waited for my eloquence a twelvemonth,
but it has returned me not a word; and I have roused
my wit for a year, but only my sluggishness has increased.
And I have sought aid among the gathering of the scribes,
but each of them has frowned and drawn back. Now, if
thou hast disclosed thy character with accuracy, <i>Come with
a sign if thou be of the truthful.</i></p>

<p>Then answered the elder, "Thou hast put a good steed
to the pace; thou hast sought water at a full stream; thou
hast given the bow to him who fashioned it; thou hast lodged
in the house him who built it." And he thought a while
till he had let his flow of wit collect, his milch-camel fill her
udder: and then he said: Wool thy ink-flask, and take thy
implements and write:</p>

<p>"Generosity (may God establish the host of thy successes)
adorns; but meanness (may fortune cast down the eyelid of
thy enviers) dishonors; the noble rewards, but the base
disappoints; the princely entertains, but the niggard frights
away; the liberal nourishes, but the churl pains; giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
relieves, but deferring torments; blessing protects, and praise
purifies; the honorable repays, for repudiation abases; the
rejection of him who should be respected is error; a denial
to the sons of hope is outrage; and none is miserly but the
fool, and none is foolish but the miser; and none hoards but
the wretched; for the pious clenches not his palms.</p>

<p>"But thy promise ceases not to fulfil; thy sentiments cease
not to relieve; nor thy clemency to indulge; nor thy new moon
to illumine; nor thy bounty to enrich; nor thy enemies to
praise thee; nor thy blade to destroy; nor thy princeship
to build up; nor thy suitor to gain; nor thy praiser
to win; nor thy kindness to succor; nor thy heaven to
rain; nor thy milk-flow to abound; nor thy refusal to be
rare. Now he who hopes in thee is an old man like a
shadow, one to whom nothing remains. He seeks thee with
a persuasion whose eagerness leaps onward; he praises thee
in choice phrases, which merit their dowries. His demand
is a light one, his claims are clear; his praise is striven for,
his blame is shunned. And behind him is a household whom
misery has touched, whom wrong has stripped, whom squalor
involves. And he is ever in tears that come at call, and
trouble that melts him, and care that is as a guest, and growing
sadness: on account of hope that has disappointed him,
and loss that has made him hoary, and the enemy that has
fixed tooth in him, and the quiet that is gone. And yet his
love has not swerved, that there should be anger at him;
nor is his wood rotten, that he should be lopped away;
nor has his breast spit foulness that he should be shaken off;
nor has his intercourse been froward that he should be hated.
Now thy honor admits not the rejection of his claim, so
whiten his hope by the lightening of his distress: then will
he publish thy praise throughout the world. So mayest
thou live to avert misfortune, and to bestow wealth; to heal
grief and to care for the aged: attended by affluence and
fresh joyousness; as long as the hall of the rich is visited, or
the delusion of the selfish is feared. And so Peace."</p>

<p>Now when he had ceased from the dictation of his address,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and showed forth his prowess in the strife of eloquence, the
company gratified him both by word and deed, and made
large to him their courtesy and their bounty. Then was
he asked from what tribe was his origin, and in what valley
was his lair; and he answered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">Ghassan is my noble kindred, and Seruj my ancient land:</div>

 <div class="verse">There my home was like the sun in splendor and mighty rank;</div>

 <div class="verse">And my dwelling was as paradise in sweetness and pleasantness and
worth.</div>

 <div class="verse">Oh, excellent were the life I led there and the plenteous delights,</div>

 <div class="verse">In the day that I drew my broidered robe in its meadow, sharp of
purpose,</div>

 <div class="verse">I walked proudly in the mantle of youth and looked upon goodly
pleasures;</div>

 <div class="verse">Fearing not the visitations of time and its evil haps.</div>

 <div class="verse">Now if grief could kill, surely I should perish from my abiding
griefs;</div>

 <div class="verse">Or if past life could be redeemed my good heart's blood should
redeem it.</div>

 <div class="verse">For death is better for a man than to live the life of a beast.</div>

 <div class="verse">When the ring of subjection leads him to mighty trouble and outrage,</div>

 <div class="verse">And he sees lions whom the paws of assailing hyenas seize.</div>

 <div class="verse">But the fault is in the time: but for its ill luck character would
not miss its place:</div>

 <div class="verse">If the time were upright, then would the conditions of men be upright
in it.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After this his story reached the Governor, who filled his
mouth with pearls, and bade him join himself to his followers,
and preside over his court of public writing. But
the gifts sufficed him, and unwillingness restrained him from
office. Said the narrator: Now I had recognized the wood
of his tree before the ripening of his fruit: And I had
nigh roused the people to the loftiness of his worth before
that his full moon shone forth. But he hinted to me by a
twinkle of his eyelid that I should not bare his sword from
its sheath. And when he was going forth, full of purse,
and parting from us, having gotten victory, I escorted him,
performing the duty of respect, and chiding him for his
refusal of office. But he turned away with a smile and
recited with a chant:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">Sure to traverse the lands in poverty is dearer to me than rank:</div>

 <div class="verse">For in rulers there is caprice and fault-finding, oh what fault-finding!</div>

 <div class="verse">There is none of them who completes his good work, or who builds
up where has laid foundation.</div>

 <div class="verse">So let not the glare of the mirage beguile thee; undertake not that

<h4>THE SEVENTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF BARAK'ID")</small><a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></h4>


<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I had determined on
journeying from Barak'id; but now I noted the signs of
the coming feast, and I disliked to set forth from the city
until I had witnessed there the day of adornment. So when
it came on with its rites, bounden or of free will, and brought
up its horsemen and footmen, I followed the tradition in new
apparel, and went forth with the people to keep festival.
Now when the congregation of the prayer-court was gathered
and ranged, and the crowding took men's breath, there ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>peared
an old man in a pair of cloaks, and his eyes were
closed: and he bore on his arm what was like a horse-bag,
and had for a guide an old woman like a goblin. Then he
stopped, as stops one tottering to sink, and greeted with
the greeting of him whose voice is feeble. And when he
had made an end of his salutation he circled his five fingers
in his wallet, and brought forth scraps of paper that had
been written on with colors of dyes in the season of leisure,
and gave them to his old beldame, bidding her to detect
each simple one. So whenever she perceived of any that
his hand was moist in bounty, she cast one of the papers
before him. Said Al Harith: Now cursed fate allotted to
me a scrap whereon was written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Sure I have become crushed with pains and fears;</div>
  <div class="verse">Tried by the proud one, the crafty, the assailer,</div>
  <div class="verse">By the traitor among my brethren, who hates me for my need,</div>
  <div class="verse">By jading from those who work to undo my toils.</div>
  <div class="verse">How oft do I burn through spites and penury and wandering;</div>
  <div class="verse">How oft do I tramp in shabby garb, thought of by none.</div>
  <div class="verse">Oh, would that fortune when it wronged me had slain my babes!</div>
  <div class="verse">For were not my cubs torments to me and ills,</div>
  <div class="verse">I would not have addressed my hopes to kin or lord:</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor would I draw my skirts along the track of abasement.</div>
  <div class="verse">For my garret would be more seemly for me, and my rags more honorable.</div>
  <div class="verse">Now is there a generous man who will see that the lightening of my loads must be by a denar;</div>
  <div class="verse">Or will quench the heat of my anxiety by a shirt and trousers?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Said Al Harith, son of Hammam: Now when I had
looked on the garb of the verses, I longed for a knowledge
of him who wove it, the broiderer of its pattern. And my
thought whispered to me that the way to him was through
the old woman, and advised me that a fee to an informer is
lawful. So I watched her, and she was wending through
the rows, row by row, begging a dole of the hands, hand
by hand. But not at all did the trouble prosper her; no
purse shed aught upon her palm. Wherefore when her
soliciting was baffled, and her circuit wearied her, she commended
herself to God with the "Return," and addressed
herself to collect the scraps of paper. But the devil made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
her forget the scrap that I held, and she turned not aside
to my spot: but went back to the old man weeping at the
denial, complaining of the oppression of the time. And he
said, "In God's hands I am, to God I commit my case;
there is no strength or power but by God," then he recited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">There remains not any pure, not any sincere; not a spring, not a
helper:</div>

  <div class="verse">But of baseness there is one level; not any is trusty, not any of
worth.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then said he to her, "Cheer thy soul and promise it good;
collect the papers and count them." She said, "Truly I
counted them when I asked them back, and I found that one
of them the hand of loss had seized." He said, "Perdition
on thee, wretch; shall we be hindered, alas, both of the prey
and the net, both of the brand and the wick? Surely this is
a new handful to the load." Then did the old woman hasten
back, retracing her path to seek her scroll; and when she
drew near to me I put with the paper a dirhem and a mite,
and said to her, "If thou hast a fondness for the polished,
the engraved (and I pointed to the dirhem), show me the
secret, the obscure; but if thou willest not to explain, take
then the mite and begone." Then she inclined to the getting
of that whole full moon, the bright-faced, the large.
So she said, "Quit contention and ask what thou wilt."
Whereupon I asked her of the old man and his country, of
the poem, and of him who wove its mantle. She said,
"Truly, the old man is of the people of Seruj, and he it was
who broidered that woven poem." Then she snatched the
dirhem with the snatch of a hawk, and shot away as shoots
the darting arrow. But it troubled my heart that perchance
it was Abu Zayd who was indicated, and my grief kindled
at his mishap with his eyes. And I should have preferred to
have gone suddenly on him and talked to him, that I might
test the quality of my discernment upon him. But I was
unable to come to him save by treading on the necks of the
congregation, a thing forbidden in the law; and, moreover,
I was unwilling that people should be annoyed by me, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
that blame should arrive to me. So I cleaved to my place,
but made his form the fetter of my sight, until the sermon
was ended, and to leap to him was lawful. Then I went
briskly to him and examined him in spite of the closing of
his eyelids. And, lo! my shrewdness was as the shrewdness
of Ibn 'Abbas, and my discernment as the discernment of
Iyas. So at once I made myself known, and presented him
with one of my tunics, and bade him to my bread. And
he was joyful at my bounty and recognition, and acceded
to the call to my loaves; and he set forth, and my hand was
his leading cord, my shadow his conductor; and the old
woman was the third prop of the pot; yes, by the Watcher
from whom no secret is hidden! Now, when he had taken
seat in my nest, and I had set before him what hasty meal
was in my power, he said, "Harith, is there with us a
third?" I said, "There is none but the old woman." He
said, "From her no secret is withheld." Then he opened
his eyes and stared round with the twin balls, and, lo!
the two lights of his face kindled like the Farkadan. And I
was joyful at the safety of his sight, but marveled at the
strangeness of his ways. Nor did quiet possess me, nor did
patience fit with me, until I asked him, "What led thee to
feign blindness; thou, with thy journeying in desolate places,
and thy traversing of wildernesses, and thy pushing into
far lands?" But he made show as if his mouth were full,
and kept as though busied with his meal, until, when he had
fulfilled his need, he sharpened his look upon me and recited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Since Time (and he is the father of mankind) makes himself blind
to the right in his purposes and aims,</div>

  <div class="verse">I too have assumed blindness, so as to be called a brother of it.
What wonder that one should match himself with his father!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then said he to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> "Rise, and go to the closet, and fetch
me alkali that may clear the eye, and clean the hand, and
soften the skin, and perfume the breath, and brace the gums,
and strengthen the stomach: and let it be clean of box, fragrant
of odor, new of pounding, delicate of powdering; so
that one touching it shall count it to be eye-paint, and one
smelling it shall fancy it to be camphor. And join with
it a toothpick choice in material, delightful in use, goodly
in shape, that invites to the repast: and let it have the
slimness of a lover, and the polish of a sword, and the sharpness
of the lance of war, and the pliancy of a green bough."
Said Al Harith: Then I rose to do what he bade that I might
rid him of the trace of his food; and thought not that he
purposed to deceive by sending me into the closet; nor suspected
that he was mocking of his messenger when he called
for the alkali and toothpick. But when I returned with
what was asked for, in less than the drawing of a breath, I
found that the hall was empty, and that the old man and
woman had sped away. Then was I extreme in anger at
his deceit, and I pressed on his track in search of him;
but he was as one who is sunk in the sea, or has been borne
aloft to the clouds of heaven.</p>


<h4>THE EIGHTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF MA'AKRAH")</small><a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: Among the wonders
of time, I saw that two suitors came before the Kadi of
Ma'arrat an No'man. From the one of them the two excellencies
of life had departed, while the other was as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
bough of the ben tree. And the old man said: God
strengthen the judge, as by him he strengthens whoever seeks
judgment. Behold I had a slave girl, elegant of shape,
smooth of cheek, patient to labor; at one time she ambled like
a good steed, at another she slept quietly in her bed: even in
July thou wouldst feel her touch to be cool. She had understanding
and discretion, sharpness and wit, a hand with
fingers, but a mouth without teeth: yet did she pique as with
tongue of snake, and saunter in training robe; and she was
displayed in blackness and whiteness; and she drank, but not
from cisterns. She was now truth-telling, now beguiling;
now hiding, now peeping forth; yet fitted for employment,
obedient in poverty and in wealth: if thou didst spurn she
showed affection, but if thou didst put her from thee, she remained
quietly apart. Generally would she serve thee, and
be courteous to thee, though sometimes she might be froward
to thee and pain thee, and trouble thee. Now this youth
asked her service of me for a purpose of his own, and I made
her his servant, without reward, on the condition that he
should enjoy the use of her, but not burden her with more
than she could bear. But he forced on her too hard a work,
and exacted of her long labor; then returned her to me broken
in health, offering a compensation which I accept not.</p>

<p>Then said the youth: Sure the old man is more truthful
than the Kata: but as for my hurting her it fell out by mistake.
And now have I pledged to him in payment of his
damage, a slave<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> of mine, of equal birth as regards either kin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
tracing his lineage to Al Kayn, free from stain and disgrace,
whose place was the apple of his master's eye. He showed
forth kindness, and called up admiration; he nourished mankind,
and set guard on his tongue. If he was placed in
power he was generous, if he marked aught for his own he
was noble with it; if he was supplied he gave of his supply,
and when he was asked for more he added. He stayed not
in the house, and rarely visited his wives, save two by two.
He was generous with his possession, he was lofty in his
bounty; he kept with his spouse although she was not of his
own clay; and there was pleasure in his comeliness, although
he was not desired for his effeminacy.</p>

<p>Then said to them the Kadi, "Now either explain or depart."
Then pressed forward the lad, and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">He lent me a needle to darn my rags, which use has worn and
blackened;</div>

 <div class="verse">And its eye broke in my hand by chance, as I drew the thread
through it.</div>

 <div class="verse">But the old man would not forgive me the paying for it when he
saw that it was spoiled;</div>

 <div class="verse">But said, "Give me a needle like it, or a price, after thou hast
mended it."</div>

 <div class="verse">And he keeps my <i>kohl</i>-pencil by him as a pledge: oh, the shame that
he has gotten by so doing:</div>

 <div class="verse">For my eye is dry through giving him this pledge; my hand fails
to ransom its anointer.</div>

 <div class="verse">Now by this statement fathom the depth of my misery and pity
one unused to bear it.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then turned the Kadi to the old man, and said "Come, speak without glozing." and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">I swear by the holy place of sacrifice, and the devout whom the
slope of Mina brings together;</div>

 <div class="verse">If the time had been my helper, thou wouldst not have seen me
taking in pledge the pencil which he has pledged to me.</div>

 <div class="verse">Nor would I bring myself to seek a substitute for a needle that he
had spoiled; no, nor the price of it.</div>

 <div class="verse">But the bow of calamities shoots at me with deadly arrows from
here and there:</div>

 <div class="verse">And to know my condition is to know his; misery, and distress,
and exile, and sickness.</div>

 <div class="verse">Fortune has put us on a level: I am his like in misery, and he is
as I.</div>

 <div class="verse">He can not ransom his pencil now that it lies pledged in my hand:</div>

 <div class="verse">And, through the narrowness of my own means, it is not within
my bounds to forgive him for his offending.</div>

 <div class="verse">Now this is my tale and his: so look upon us, and judge between
us, and pity us.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now when the Kadi had learned their stories, and was
aware of their penury and their distinction, he took out for
them a denar from under his prayer-cushion, and said, "With
this end and decide your contention." But the old man
caught it before the youth, and claimed the whole of it in
earnest, not in jest, saying to the youth, "Half is mine as my
share of the bounty, and thy share is mine, in payment for
my needle: nor do I swerve from justice, so come and take
thy pencil." Now there fell on the youth, at the words of
the old man, a sadness at which the heart of the Kadi grew
sullen, stirring its sorrow for the lost denar. Yet did he
cheer the concern of the youth and his anguish by a few dirhems
which he doled to him. Then he said to the two,
"Avoid transactions, and put away disputes, and come not
before me with wranglings, for I have no purse of fine-money
for you." And they rose to go out from him, rejoicing at his
gift, fluent in his praise. But as for the Kadi, his ill-humor
subsided not after his stone had dripped; his sad look cleared
not away after his rock had oozed. But when he recovered
from his fit he turned to his attendants, and said, "My perception
is imbued with the thought, and my guess announces
to me, that these are practisers of craft, not suitors in a
claim: but what is the way to fathom them, and to draw forth
their secret?" Then said to him the Knowing One of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
assemblage, the Light of his following: "Surely the discovery
of what they hide must be through themselves." So
he bade an attendant follow them and bring them back;
and when they stood before him he said to them, "Tell me
truly your camel's age: so shall ye be secure from the consequence
of your deceit." Then did the lad shrink back and
ask for pardon; but the old man stepped forward and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I am the Seruji and this is my son; and the cub at the proving is
like the lion.</div>

  <div class="verse">Now never has his hand nor mine done wrong in matter of needle
or pencil:</div>

  <div class="verse">But only fortune, the harming, the hostile, has brought us to this,
that we came forth to beg</div>

  <div class="verse">Of each one whose palm is moist, whose spring is sweet; of each
whose palm is close, whose hand is fettered;</div>

  <div class="verse">By every art, and with every aim: by earnest, if it prosper, and
if not, by jest.</div>

  <div class="verse">That we may draw forth a drop for our thirsty lot, and consume
our life in wretched victual.</div>

  <div class="verse">And afterward Death is on the watch for us: if he fall not on us
to-day he will fall to-morrow.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then said the Kadi to him, "Oh rare! how admirable are
the breathings of thy mouth; well done! should I say of thee,
were it not for the guile that is in thee. Now know that I
am of those that warn thee, and will beware of thee. So act
not again deceitfully with judges, but fear the might of those
who bear rule. For not every minister will excuse, and not
at every season will speech be listened to." Then the old
man promised to follow his counsel, and to abstain from disguising
his character. And he departed from the Kadi's
presence, while the guile beamed from his forehead. Said
Al Harith, son of Hammam: Now I never saw aught more
wonderful than these things in the changes of my journeys,
nor read aught like them in the records of books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>


<h4>THE NINTH ASSEMBLY,<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF ALEXANDRIA")</small><a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: The liveliness of
youth and the desire of gain sped me on until I had traversed
all that is between Farghanah and Ghanah. And
I dived into depths to gather fruits, and plunged into perils
to reach my needs. Now I had caught from the lips of the
learned, and understood from the commandments of the wise,
that it behooves the well-bred, the sagacious, when he enters
a strange city, to conciliate its Kadi and possess himself of
his favor: that his back may be strengthened in litigation,
that he may be secure in a strange land from the wrong of
the powerful. So I took this doctrine as my guide and made
it the leading-cord to my advantages. And I entered not a
city, I went not into a lair, but I mingled myself with its
judge as water is mingled with wine, and strengthened my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>self
by his patronage as bodies are strengthened by souls.
Now while I was in presence of the judge of Alexandria one
cold evening, and he had brought out the alms-money to divide
it among the needy, behold there entered an ill-looking
old man whom a young matron dragged along. And she said:
God strengthen the Kadi and through him make concord to
be lasting: know that I am a woman of stock the most noble,
of root the most pure, of mother's and father's kin the most
honorable: my character is moderation, my disposition is
contentment; my nature is to be a goodly help-meet; between
me and my neighbors is a wide difference. Now whenever
there wooed me any who had built up honor or were
lords of wealth my father silenced and chid them and misliked
their suit and their gift: making plea that he had covenanted
with God Most High that he would not ally himself
save with the master of a handicraft. Then did Providence
destine for my calamity and pain that this deceiver should
present himself in my father's hall; and swear among his
people that he fulfilled his condition: asserting that long
time he had strung pearl to pearl and sold them for great
price. Then was my father deceived by the gilding of his
falsehood, and married me to him before proving his condition.
And when he had drawn me forth from my covert, and
carried me away from my people, and removed me to his
habitation, and brought me under his bond, I found him
slothful, a sluggard; I discovered him to be a lie-a-bed, a
slumberer. Now I had come to him with apparel and goodly
show, with furniture and affluence. But he ceased not to
sell it in a losing market and to squander the price in greedy
feeding, until he had altogether destroyed whatever was mine,
and spent my property on his need. So when he had made
to me to forget the taste of rest and left my house cleaner
than my hand's palm, I said to him, "Sir, know that there
is no concealment after distress, no perfume after the wedding.
Rise up then to gain something by thy trade, to gather
the fruit of thy skill." But he declared that his trade had
been struck with slackness through the violence that was
abroad in the earth. Also I have a boy by him, thin as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
toothpick: neither of us gets a fill by him, and through hunger
our weeping to him ceases not. So I have brought him to
thee and set him before thee, that thou mayest test the substance
of his assertion, and decide between us as God shall
show thee.</p>

<p>Then turned the Kadi to him and said: "Thou hast
heard thy wife's story; now testify of thyself: else will I
discover thy deceit and bid thy imprisonment." But he
looked down as looks the serpent; then girt up his garment
for a long strife, and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Hear my story, for it is a wonder; there is laughter in its tale, and
there is wailing.</div>

  <div class="verse">I am a man on whose qualities there is no blame, neither is there
suspicion on his glory.</div>

  <div class="verse">Seruj is my home where I was born, and my stock is Ghassan when
I trace my lineage:</div>

  <div class="verse">And study is my business; to dive deep in learning is my pursuit;
and, oh! how excellent a seeking.</div>

  <div class="verse">And my capital is the magic of speech, out of which are molded
both verse and prose.</div>

  <div class="verse">I dive into the deep of eloquence, and from it I choose the pearls
and select them:</div>

  <div class="verse">I cull of speech the ripe fruit and the new; while another gathers
but firing of the wood:</div>

  <div class="verse">I take the phrase of silver, and when I have molded it men say
that it is gold.</div>

  <div class="verse">Now formerly I drew forth wealth by the learning I had gotten;
I milked by it:</div>

  <div class="verse">And my foot's sole in its dignity mounted to ranges above which
were no higher steps.</div>

  <div class="verse">Oft were the presents brought in pomp to my dwelling, but I accepted
not every one who gave.</div>

  <div class="verse">But to-day learning is the chattel of slackest sale in the market of
him on whom hope depends.</div>

  <div class="verse">The honor of its sons is not respected; neither are relationship and
alliance with them regarded.</div>

  <div class="verse">It is as though they were corpses in their courtyards, from whose
stench men withdraw and turn aside.</div>

  <div class="verse">Now my heart is confounded through my trial by the times; strange
is their changing.</div>

  <div class="verse">The stretch of my arm is straitened through the straitness of my
hand's means; cares and grief assail me.</div>

  <div class="verse">And my fortune, the blameworthy, has led me to the paths of that
which honor deems base.</div>

  <div class="verse">For I sold until there remained to me not a mat nor household
goods to which I might turn.</div>

  <div class="verse"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></div>

  <div class="verse">So I indebted myself until I had burdened my neck by the carrying
of a debt such that ruin had been lighter.</div>

  <div class="verse">Then five days I wrapped my entrails upon hunger; but when the
hunger scorched me,</div>

  <div class="verse">I could see no goods except her outfit, in the selling of which I
might go about and bestir myself.</div>

  <div class="verse">So I went about with it; but my soul was loathing, and my eye
tearful, and my heart saddened.</div>

  <div class="verse">But when I made free with it, I passed not the bound of her consent,
that her wrath should rise against me.</div>

  <div class="verse">And if what angers her be her fancying that it was my fingers that
should make gain by stringing;</div>

  <div class="verse">Or that when I purposed to woo her I tinseled my speech that my
need might prosper:</div>

  <div class="verse">I swear by him to whose Ka'beh the companies journey when the
fleet camels speed them onward,</div>

  <div class="verse">That deceit toward chaste ladies is not of my nature, nor are
glozing and lying my badge.</div>

  <div class="verse">Since I was reared naught has attached to my hand save the swiftly
moving reeds and the books:</div>

  <div class="verse">For it is my wit that strings necklaces, not my hand; what is
strung is my poetry, and not chaplets.</div>

  <div class="verse">And this is the craft I meant as that by which I gathered and
gained.</div>

  <div class="verse">So give ear to my explaining, as thou hast given ear to her; and
show respect to neither, but judge as is due.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now when he had completed the structure of his story and
perfected his recitation, the Kadi turned to the young
woman, being heart-struck at the verses, and said, now
that it is settled among all judges and those who bear authority
that the race of the generous is perished, and that
the times incline to the niggardly. Now I imagine that thy
husband is truthful in his speech, free from blame. For
lo! he has acknowledged the debt to thee, and spoken the
clear truth; he has given proof that he can string verses,
and it is plain that he is bared to the bone. Now to vex him
who shows excuse is baseness, to imprison the destitute is a
sin: to conceal poverty is self-denial, to await relief with patience
is devotion. So return to thy chamber and pardon
the master of thy virginity: refrain from thy sharpness of
tongue and submit to the will of thy Lord. Then in the
almsgiving he assigned them a portion, and of the dirhems
he gave them a pinch; and said to them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> "Beguile yourselves
with this drop, moisten yourselves with this driblet: and endure
against the fraud and the trouble of the time, for 'it
may be that God will bring victory or some ordinance from
himself.'" Then they arose to go, and on the old man was
the joy of one loosed from the bond, and the exulting of one
who is in affluence after need.</p>

<p>Said the narrator: Now I knew that he was Abu Zayd
in the hour that his son peeped forth and his spouse reviled
him: and I went near to declare his versatility and the fruiting
of his divers branches. But then I was afraid that the
Kadi would hit on his falsehood and the lacking of his tongue,
and not see fit, when he knew him, to train him to his
bounty. So I forebore from speech with the forbearing of
one who doubts, and I folded up mention of him as the roll
is folded over the writing: save that when he had departed
and had come whither he was to come, I said, "If there were
one who would set out on his track, he might bring us the
kernel of his story, and what tissues he is spreading forth."
Then the Kadi sent one of his trusty ones after him and bade
him to spy out of his tidings. But he delayed not to return
bounding in, and to come back loudly laughing. Said the
Kadi to him, "Well, Abu Maryam!" He said, "I have
seen a wonder; I have heard what gives me a thrill." Said
the Kadi to him, "What hast thou seen, and what is it thou
hast learned?" He said, "Since the old man went forth
he has not ceased to clap with his hands and to caper with his
feet and to sing with the full of his cheeks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I was near falling into trouble through an impudent jade;</div>
  <div class="verse">And should have gone to prison but for the Kadi of Alexandria."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the Kadi laughed till his hat fell off, and his composure
was lost: but when he returned to gravity and had
followed excess by prayer for pardon, he said, "O God, by
the sanctity of thy most honored servants, forbid that I should
imprison men of letters." Then said he to that trusty one,
"Hither with him!" and he set forth earnest in the search;
but returned after a while, telling that the man was gone.
Then said the Kadi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> "Know that if he had been here he
should have had no cause to fear, for I would have imparted to
him as he deserves; I would have shown him that <i>the latter
state is better for him than the former</i>." Said Al Harith,
son of Hammam, Now, when I saw the leaning of the Kadi
toward him, and that yet the fruit of the Kadi's notice was
lost to him, there came on me the repentance of Al Farazdak
when he put away Nawar, or of Al Kosa'i when the daylight
appeared.</p>


<h4>THE TENTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF RAHBAH")</small><a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: The summoning of
desire called me to Rahbah, the city of Malik, son of Towk,
and I obeyed it, mounted on a fleet camel, and unsheathing
an active purpose. Now when I had cast my anchors there,
and fastened my ropes, and had gone forth from the bath
after shaving my head, I saw a boy cast in the mold of
comeliness, and clothed by beauty in the garb of perfection;
and an old man was holding on to his sleeve, asserting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
he had slain his son; but the boy denied knowledge of him
and was horror-struck at his suspicion; and the contention
between them scattered its sparks, and the crowding
upon them was made up of good and bad. Now after their
quarreling had been excessive, they agreed to refer to the
Governor of the town; so they hastened to his court with the
speed of Sulayk in his career; and when they were there the
old man renewed his charge and claimed help. So the Governor
made the boy speak, for the boy had already fascinated
him by the graces of his bright brow, and cloven his understanding
by the disposition of his forelocks. And the boy
said, "It is the lie of a great liar against one who is no
blood-shedder, and the slander of a knave against one who is
not an assassin." Then said the Governor to the old man,
"If two just Moslems testify for thee, well; if not, demand
of him the oath." Said the old man, "Surely he struck him
down remote from men, and shed his blood when alone; and
how can I have a witness, when on the spot there was no beholder?
But empower me to dictate an oath that it may appear
to thee whether he speaks true or lies." He said to him,
"Thou hast authority for that; thou with thy vehement grief
for thy slain son." Then said the old man to the boy: "Say,
I swear by him who hath adorned foreheads with forelocks,
and eyes with their black and white, and eyebrows with separation,
and smiling teeth with regularity, and eyelids with
languor, and noses with straightness, and cheeks with flame,
and mouths with purity, and fingers with softness, and
waists with slenderness, that I have not killed thy son by
negligence, nor of wilfulness, nor made his head a sheath to
my sword; if it be otherwise, may God strike my eyelid with
soreness, and my cheek with freckles, and my forelocks with
dropping, and my palm-shoot with greenness, and my rose
with the ox-eye, and my musk with a foul steam, and my
full moon with waning, and my silver with tarnishing, and
my rays with the dark."</p>

<p>Then said the boy, "The scorching of affliction be my lot
rather than to take such an oath! let me yield to vengeance
rather than swear as no one has ever sworn!" But the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
man would naught but make him swallow the oath which he
had framed for him, and the draughts which he had bittered.
And the dispute ceased not to blaze between them, and the
road of concord to be rugged. Now the boy, while thus resisting,
captivated the Governor by his motions, and made
him covet that he should belong to him; until love subdued
his heart and fixed in his breast; and the passion which enslaved
him, and the desire which he had imagined tempted
him to liberate the boy and then get possession of him, to free
him from the noose of the old man, and then catch him himself.
So he said to the old man, "Hast thou a mind for
that which is more seemly in the stronger and nearer to god-fearing?"
He said, "Whither art thou pointing that I
should follow and not delay?" He said, "I think it well
that thou cease from altercation and be content with a hundred
denars, on condition that I take on myself part of it, and
collect the rest as may be." Said the old man, "I refuse
not; but let there be no failure to thy promise." Then the
Governor paid him down twenty and assigned among his attendants
the making up of fifty. But the robe of evening
grew dim, and from this cause the rain of collection was
cut short. Then he said, "Take what is ready and leave
disputing; and on me be it to-morrow to accomplish that the
rest be doled to thee and reach thee." Said the old man, "I
will do this on the condition that I keep close to him to-night,
that the pupil of my eye guard him, until when on the dawning
of the morn he has made up what remains of the sum
of reconciliation, shell may get clear of chick, and he may
go guiltless as the wolf went guiltless of the blood of the son
of Jacob." Then said to him the Governor, "I think that
thou dost not impose what is immoderate or ask what is excessive."</p>

<p>Said Al Harith, son of Hammam: Now when I perceived
that the pleadings of the old man were as the pleadings of
Ibn Surayj, I knew him to be the Glory of the Serujis: and I
delayed until the stars of the darkness glittered, and the
knots of the crowd dispersed: and then I sought the Governor's
courtyard; and lo! the old man guarding the youth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>And I adjured him by God to say whether he was Abu Zayd:
he said, "Yes, by him who hath permitted the chase."
I said, "Who is this boy, after whom the understanding
darts?" He said, "In kin he is my chick, and in making
gain my springe." I said, "Wilt thou not be satisfied with
the graces of his make, and spare the Governor temptation
by his forelock?" He said, "Were it not that his forehead
put forth its ringlets, I should not have snatched the fifty."
Then he said, "Pass the night near me that we may quench
the fire of grief, and give enjoyment its turn after separation.
For I have resolved to slip away at dawn, and to burn the
Governor's heart with the flame of regret." Said Al Harith,
Then I spent the night with him in conversation more pleasant
than a garden of flowers, or a woodland of trees: until
when the Wolf's Tail lighted the horizon, and the brightening
of the daybreak came on in its time, he mounted the back of
the highway, and left the Governor to taste burning torment.
And he committed to me, in the hour of his departure a paper
firmly closed, and said, "Hand it to the Governor when he
has been bereft of composure, when he has convinced himself
of our flight." But I broke the seal as one who would free
himself from a letter of Mutelemmis, and behold there was
written in it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">Tell the Governor whom I have left, after my departure, repenting,
grieving, biting his hands,</div>

 <div class="verse">That the old man has stolen his money and the young one his heart;
and he is scorched in the flame of a double regret.</div>

 <div class="verse">He was generous with his coin when love blinded his eye, and he
has ended with losing either.</div>

 <div class="verse">Calm thy grief, O afflicted, for it profits not to seek the traces after
the substance is gone.</div>

 <div class="verse">But if what has befallen thee is terrible to thee as the ill-fate of
Al Hosayn is terrible to the Moslems;</div>

 <div class="verse">Yet hast thou gotten in exchange for it understanding and caution;
and the wise man, the prudent, wishes for these.</div>

 <div class="verse">So henceforth resist desires, and know that the chasing of gazelles
is not easy;</div>

 <div class="verse">No, nor does every bird enter the springe, even though it be surrounded
by silver.</div>

 <div class="verse">And how many a one who seeks to make a prey becomes a prey
himself, and meets with naught but the shoes of Honayn!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Now consider well, and forecast not every thundercloud: many a
thundercloud may have in it the bolts of death:</div>

 <div class="verse">And cast down thine eye, that thou mayest rest from a passion by
which thou wouldest clothe thyself with the garment of infamy and
disgrace.</div>

 <div class="verse">For the trouble of man is the following of the soul's desire; and
the seed of desire is the longing look of the eye.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Said the narrator, But I tore the paper piecemeal, and
cared not whether he blamed or pardoned me.</p>


<h4>THE ELEVENTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF SAWEH")</small><a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I was aware of
hardness of heart while I sojourned at Saweh. So I betook
myself to the Tradition handed down, that its cure is by
visiting the tombs. And when I had reached the mansion of
the dead, the storehouse of moldering remains, I saw an assemblage
over a grave that had been dug, and a corpse that
was being buried. So I drew aside to them, meditating on
the end of man, and calling to mind those of my people who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
were gone. And when they had sepulchered the dead, and
the crying of Alas! was over, an old man stood forth on high,
from a hillock, leaning on a staff. And he had veiled his
face with his cloak, and disguised his form for craftiness.
And he said: <i>Let those who work, work for an end like this.</i>
Now take thought, O yet negligent and gird yourselves, ye
slothful, and look well, ye observers. How is it with you
that the burying of your fellows grieves you not, and that the
pouring in of the mold frightens you not; that ye heed not
the visitations of misfortune; that ye prepare not for the
going down to your graves; that ye are not moved to tears
at the eye that weeps; that ye take not warning at the death-message
when it is heard; that ye are not affrighted when an
intimate is lost; that ye are not saddened when the mourning
assembly is gathered? One of you follows home the dead
man's bier, but his heart is set toward his house; and he is
present at the burying of his kinsman, but his thought is of
securing his portion. He leaves his loved friend with the
worms, then retires alone with his pipes and lutes. Ye have
sorrowed over your riches, if but a grain were notched away,
yet have ye been forgetful of the cutting off of your friends:
and ye have been cast down at the befalling of adversity, but
have made little of the perishing of your kindred. Ye have
laughed at a funeral as ye laughed not in the hour of dancing;
ye have walked wantonly behind biers, as ye walked not in
the day that ye grasped gifts. Ye have turned from the recital
of the mourning women to the preparing of banquets;
and from the anguish of the bereaved to daintiness in feastings.
Ye care not for him who molders, and ye move not
the thought of death in your mind. So that it is as if ye
were joined to Death by clientship, or had gotten security
from Time, or were confident of your own safety, or had
made sure of a peace with the Destroyer of delights. No!
it is an ill thing that ye imagine. Again, no! surely ye shall
learn. Then he recited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">O thou who claimest understanding; how long, O brother of delusion,
wilt thou marshal sin and blame, and err exceeding error?</div>

 <div class="verse">Is not the shame plain to thee? doth not hoariness warn thee? (and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>in its counsel there is no doubtfulness); nor hath thy hearing become
deaf.</div>

 <div class="verse">Is not Death calling thee? doth he not make thee hear his voice?
dost thou not fear thy passing away, so as to be wary and anxious?</div>

 <div class="verse">How long wilt thou be bewildered in carelessness, and walk proudly
in vanity, and go eagerly to diversion, as if death were not for all?</div>

 <div class="verse">Till when will last thy swerving, and thy delaying to mend habits
that unite in thee vices whose every sort shall be collected in thee?</div>

 <div class="verse">If thou anger thy Master thou art not disquieted at it; but if thy
scheme be bootless thou burnest with vexation.</div>

 <div class="verse">If the graving of the yellow one gleam to thee thou art joyful; but
if the bier pass by thee thou feignest grief, and there is no grief.</div>

 <div class="verse">Thou resistest him who counseleth righteousness; thou art hard in
understanding; thou swervest aside: but thou followest the guiding
of him who deceiveth, who lieth, who defameth.</div>

 <div class="verse">Thou walkest in the desire of thy soul; thou schemest after money;
but thou forgettest the darkness of the grave, and rememberest not
what is there.</div>

 <div class="verse">But if true happiness had looked upon thee, thy own look would
not have led thee amiss; nor wouldest thou be saddened when the
preaching wipeth away griefs.</div>

 <div class="verse">Thou shalt weep blood, not tears, when thou perceivest that no
company can protect thee in the Court of Assembling; no kinsman of
mother or father.</div>

 <div class="verse">It is as though I could see thee when thou goest down to the vault
and divest deep; when thy kinsmen have committed thee to a place
narrower than a needle's eye.</div>

 <div class="verse">There is the body stretched out that the worms may devour it, until
the coffin-wood is bored through and the bones molder.</div>

 <div class="verse">And afterward there is no escape from that review of souls: since
Sirat is prepared; its bridge is stretched over the fire to every one who
cometh thither.</div>

 <div class="verse">And how many a guide shall go astray! and how many a great one
shall be vile! and how many a learned one shall slip and say, "The
business surpasseth."</div>

 <div class="verse">Therefore hasten, O simple one, to that by which the bitter is made
sweet; for thy life is now near to decay and thou hast not withdrawn
thyself from blame.</div>

 <div class="verse">And rely not on fortune though it be soft, though it be gay: for so
wilt thou be found like one deceived by a viper that spitteth venom.</div>

 <div class="verse">And lower thyself from thy loftiness; for death is meeting thee and
reaching at thy collar; and he is one who shrinketh not back when
he hath purposed.</div>

 <div class="verse">And avoid proud turning away of the cheek if fortune have prospered
thee: bridle thy speech if it would run astray; for how happy
is he who bridleth it!</div>

 <div class="verse">And relieve the brother of sorrow, and believe him when he speaketh
and mend thy ragged conduct; for he hath prospered who mendeth
it.</div>

 <div class="verse">And plume him whose plumage hath fallen in calamity great or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
small; and sorrow not at the loss, and be not covetous in amassing.</div>

 <div class="verse">And resist thy base nature, and accustom thy hand to liberality,
and listen not to blame for it, and keep thy hand from hoarding.</div>

 <div class="verse">And make provision of good for thy soul, and leave that which will
bring on ill, and prepare the ship for thy journey, and dread the deep
of the sea.</div>

 <div class="verse">Thus have I given my precepts, friends, and shown as one who
showeth clearly: and happy the man who walketh by my doctrines
and maketh them his example.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he drew back his sleeve from an arm strong of sinew,
on which he had fastened the splints of deceit not of fracture;
presenting himself to beg in the garb of impudence:
and by it he beguiled those people until his sleeve was
brimmed and full; then he came down from the hillock merry
at the gift. Said the narrator: But I pulled him from behind
by the hem of his cloak; and he turned to me submissively,
and faced me, saluting me: and lo! it was our old Abu
Zayd, in his very self, and in all his deceit: and I said to him,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How many, Abu Zayd, will be the varieties of thy cunning to drive
the prey to thy net? and wilt thou not care who censures?</p></blockquote>

<p>And he answered without shame and without hesitation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Look well, and leave thy blaming; for, tell me, hast thou ever known
a time when a man would not win of the world when the game was
in his hands?</p></blockquote>

<p>Then I said to him: Away with thee, Old Shaykh of Hell,
laden with infamy! For there is nothing like thee for the
fairness of thy seeming and the foulness of thy purpose; except
silvered dung or a whited sewer. Then we parted; and
I went away to the right, and he went away to the left; and
I set myself to the quarter of the south, and he set himself
to the quarter of the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>


<h4>THE TWELFTH ASSEMBLY<br />

<small>(CALLED "OF DAMASCUS")</small><a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></h4>

<p>Al Harith, son of Hammam, related: I journeyed from
Irak to the Ghutah; and then was I master of haltered steeds
and envied wealth. Freedom of arm called me to diversion,
fulness of store led me to pride. And when I had reached
the place after toil of soul, after making lean my camel, I
found it such as tongues describe it; and in it was whatever
souls long for or eyes delight in. So I thanked the bounty
of travel and ran a heat with pleasure: and began there to
break the seals of desires and gather the clusters of delights,
until some travelers were making ready for the journey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Irak, and I had so recovered from my drowning, that regret
visited me in calling to mind my home and longing after my
fold. Then I struck the tents of exile and saddled the steeds
of return. And when the company had equipped themselves
and agreement was completed, we shrank from setting forth
without taking with us a guard. And we sought one from
every tribe and used a thousand devices to obtain him. But
to find him in the clans failed, so that we thought he was not
among the living. And for the want of such a one the resolves
of the travelers were bewildered, and they assembled
at the gate of Jayrun to take counsel. And they ceased not
tying and untying, and plaiting and twining, until suggestion
was exhausted and the hoper despaired. But opposite
them was a person whose demeanor was as the demeanor of
the youthful, and his garb as the garb of monks, and in his
hand was the rosary of women, and in his eyes the mark of
giddiness from watchings. And he had fastened his gaze on
the assemblage and sharpened his ear to steal a hearing.
And when it was the time of their turning homeward and
their secret was manifest to him, he said to them, "O people,
let your care relieve itself, let your mind be tranquil; for I
will guard you with that which shall put off your fear and
show itself in accord with you." Said the narrator: Then
we asked him to show us concerning his safe conduct, and
promised him a higher wage for it than for an embassy. And
he declared it to be some words which he had been taught in
a dream, whereby to guard himself from the malice of mankind.
Then began one to steal a look at another, and to move
his eyes between glances sideward and downward. So that
it was plain to him that we thought meanly of his story, and
conceived it to be futile. Whereupon he said, How is it that
ye take my earnest for jest, and treat my gold as dross?
Now, by Allah, oft have I gone through fearful tracts and
entered among deadly dangers: and with this I have needed
not the companying of a guard or to take with me a quiver.
Besides, I will remove what gives you doubt, I will draw
away the distrust that has come on you, in that I will consent
with you in the desert and accompany you on the Semaweh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Then, if my promise has spoken you true, do ye renew my
weal and prosper my fortune: but if my mouth has lied to
you, then rend my skin and pour out my blood.</p>

<p>Said Al Harith, son of Hammam: Then we were inspired
to believe his vision and take as true what he had related;
so we ceased from disputing with him and cast lots
for carrying him. And at his word we cut the loops of hindrance,
and put away fear of harm or stay; and when the
pack-saddles were fastened on and the setting forth was near,
we sought to learn from him the magic words that we might
make them a lasting safeguard. He said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> "Let each of
you repeat the Mother of the Koran as often as day or night
comes on; then let him say with lowly tongue and humble
voice: O God! O thou who givest life to the moldering dead!
O thou who avertest harms! O thou who guardest from
terrors! O thou generous in rewarding! O thou the refuge
of suppliants! O thou the Lord of pardon and protection!
Send thy blessing on Mohammed, the Seal of thy prophets,
the Bringer of thy messages, and on the Lights of his kindred,
the Keys of his victory; and give me refuge, O God, from
the mischiefs of devils and the assaults of princes; from the
vexing of the wrongers, and from suffering through the tyrannous;
from the enmity of transgressors, and from the
transgression of enemies; from the conquest of conquerors,
from the spoiling of spoilers, from the crafts of the crafty,
from the treacheries of the treacherous; and deliver me, O
God, from the wrongfulness of neighbors and the neighborhood
of the wrongful; and keep from me the hands of the
harmful; bring me forth from the darkness of the oppressors;
place me by thy mercy among thy servants who do aright. O
God, keep me in my own land and in my journeying, in my
exile and my coming homeward, in my foraging and my return
from it, in my trafficking and my success from it, in my
adventuring and my withdrawing from it. And guard me
in myself and my property, in my honor and my goods, in
my family and my means, in my household and my dwelling,
in my strength and my fortune, in my riches and my death.
Bring not on me reverse; make not the invader lord over me,
but give me from thyself helping power. O God, watch over
me with thy eye and thy aid, distinguish me by thy safeguard
and thy bounty, befriend me with thy election and thy good,
and consign me not to the keeping of any but thee. But
grant to me health that weareth not away, and allot to me
comfort that perisheth not; and free me from the terrors of
misfortune, and shelter me with the coverings of thy boons;
make not the talons of enemies to prevail against me, for thou
art he that heareth prayer."</p>

<p>Then he looked down, and he turned not a glance, he answered
not a word: so that we said, "A fear has confounded
him or a stupor struck him dumb." Then he raised his head
and drew his breath, and said, "I swear by the heaven with
its constellations, and the earth with its plains, and the pouring
flood, and the blazing sun, and the sounding sea, and the
wind and the dust-storm, that this is the most sure of charms,
one that will best suffice you for the wearers of the helmet.
He who repeats it at the smiling of the dawn has no alarm
of danger to the red of eve; and he who whispers it to the vanguard
of the dark is safe the night long from plunder."</p>

<p>Said the narrator: So we learned it till we knew it thoroughly,
and rehearsed it together that we might not forget
it. Then we set forth, urging the beasts by prayers, not by
the song of drivers; and guarding the loads by words, not
by warriors. And our companion frequented us evening and
morning, but required not of us our promises: till when we
spied the house-tops of 'Anah, he said to us, "Now, your help,
your help!" Then we set before him the exposed and the
hidden, and showed him the corded and the sealed, and said to
him, "Decide as thou wilt, for thou wilt find among us none
but will consent." But nothing enlivened him but the light,
the adorning; nothing was comely in his eye but the coin.
So of those he loaded on his burden, and rose up with enough
to repair his poverty. Then he dodged us as dodges the cut-purse,
and slipped away from us as slips quicksilver. And
his departure saddened us, his shooting away astonished us:
and we ceased not to seek him in every assembly, and to ask
news of him from each that might mislead or guide. Until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
it was said, "Since he entered 'Anah he has not quitted the
tavern." Then the foulness of this report set me on to test
it, and to walk in a path to which I belonged not. So I went
by night to the wine-hall in disguised habit; and there was the
old man in a gay-colored dress amid casks and wine-vats;
and about him were cup-bearers surpassing in beauty, and
lights that glittered, and the myrtle and the jasmine, and
the pipe and the lute. And at one time he bade broach the
wine-casks, and at another he called the lutes to give utterance;
and now he inhaled the perfumes, and now he courted
the gazelles. But when I had thus stumbled on his hypocrisy,
and the differing of his to-day from his yesterday, I
said to him, Woe to thee, accursed! hast thou forgotten the
day at the Jayrun? But he laughed heartily, and then indited
charmingly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">I cling to journeying, I cross deserts, I loathe pride that I may cull
joy:</div>

 <div class="verse">And I plunge into floods, and tame steeds that I may draw the trains
of pleasure and delight.</div>

 <div class="verse">And I throw away staidness, and sell my land, for the sipping of
wine, for the quaffing of cups.</div>

 <div class="verse">And were it not for longing after the drinking of wine my mouth
would not utter its elegancies;</div>

 <div class="verse">Nor would my craft have lured the travelers to the land of Irak,
through my carrying of rosaries.</div>

 <div class="verse">Now be not angry, nor cry aloud, nor chide, for my excuse is plain:</div>

 <div class="verse">And wonder not at an old man who settles himself in a well-filled
house by a wine-cask that is brimming.</div>

 <div class="verse">For truly wine strengthens the bones and heals sickness and drives
away grief.</div>

 <div class="verse">And the purest of joy is when the grave man throws off the veils of
shame and flings them aside:</div>

 <div class="verse">And the sweetest of passion is when the love-crazed ceases from the
concealing of his love, and shows it openly.</div>

 <div class="verse">Then avow thy love and cool thy heart: or else the fire-staff of thy
grief will rub a spark on it;</div>

 <div class="verse">And heal thy wounds, and draw out thy cares by the daughter of
the vine, her the desired:</div>

 <div class="verse">And assign to thy evening draught a cup-bearer who will stir the
torment of desire when she gazes;</div>

 <div class="verse">And a singer who will raise such a voice that the mountains of
iron shall thrill at it when she chants.</div>

 <div class="verse">And rebel against the adviser who will not permit thee to approach
a beauty when she consents.</div>

 <div class="verse"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></div>

 <div class="verse">And range in thy cunning even to perverseness; and care not what
is said of thee, and catch what suits thee:</div>

 <div class="verse">And leave thy father if he refuse thee, and spread thy nets and hunt
who comes by thee.</div>

 <div class="verse">But be sincere with thy friend, and avoid the niggardly, and bestow
kindness, and be constant in gifts;</div>

 <div class="verse">And take refuge in repentance before thy departure; for whoso
knocks at the door of the Merciful causes it to open.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then I said to him, "O rare thy recitation, but fie on thy
misconduct! Now, by Allah, tell me from what thicket is
thy root, for thy puzzle vexes me." He said I love not to
disclose myself; yet I will intimate it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">I am the novelty of the time, the wonder of nations;</div>

 <div class="verse">I am the wily one, who plays his wiles among Arabs and foreigners;</div>

 <div class="verse">But not the less a brother of need, whom fortune vexes and wrongs,</div>

 <div class="verse">And the father of children who lie out like meat on the tray:</div>

 <div class="verse">Now the brother of want, who has a household, is not blamed if he
be wily.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Said the narrator: Then I knew that it was Abu Zayd,
the man of ill-fame and disgrace, he that blackens the face
of his hoariness. And the greatness of his contumacy offended
me, and the foulness of the path of his resorting: so
I said to him with the tongue of indignation and the confidence
of acquaintance: "Is it not time, old man, that thou
withdraw from debauchery?" But he was angry, and
growled, and his countenance changed, and he thought a while:
and then he said, "It is a night for merriment, not for rebuke,
an occasion for drinking wine, not for contention; so
leave speaking thy thought until we meet to-morrow." Then
I left him, through fear of his drunken humor, not through
dependence on his promise; and I passed my night clothed in
the mourning of repentance, at having advanced the steps of
my foot to the daughter of the vine, not of grace. And I
made a vow to God Almighty that I would never again enter
the tavern of a liquor-seller, even that I might be endowed
with the dominion of Bagdad; and that I would not look upon
the vats of wine, even that the season of youth might be restored
to me. Then we saddled the white camels in the last
darkness of night, and left together Abu Zayd and Iblis.</p>

<p class="half-title"><small>THE POETS OF ARABIA</small></p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Arabic</span> poetry, as explained in introducing the "Assemblies"
of Al Hariri, is based largely on harmonies
of sound and striking turns of phrasing. Hence most of the
poems are brief; and a poet's fame depended upon a few
brilliant couplets rather than on any sustained melody or
long-continued flight of noble thought. One distinguished
philosophical poem of some length is the well-known "Lament
of the Vizier Abu Ismael." This we give in full at the
conclusion of this section; but mainly we must illustrate the
finest flowering of Arabic verse by selecting specimens of
characteristic brevity.</p>

<p>Many of the Arab caliphs inclined to the gaieties of life
rather than to their religious duties, and kept many poets
around them. Indeed some of the caliphs themselves were
poets: The Caliph Walid composed music as well as verse;
and was hailed by his immediate companions as a great artist.
His neglect of religion, however, was so reckless as to rouse
the resentment of his people, and he lost his throne and life.</p>

<p>Most noted of all the Arab poets was Mutanabbi (905-965).
His fantastic imagery and extravagant refinements
of language were held by his admirers to be the very perfection
of literature. More than forty commentaries were
written to explain the subtleties of his verse. Such, indeed,
was the intensity of Mutanabbi's poetic ecstasy that he fancied
himself a prophet and began to preach a new religion,
until a term in prison persuaded him to cling to the accepted
form of Mohammedanism. In one well-known passage ridiculed
by the great French critic, Huart, Mutanabbi says of
an advancing army that it was so vast</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"The warriors marched hidden in their dust;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">They saw only with their ears."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>
<p>The commentators explain, perhaps unnecessarily, that this
means that the warriors' senses were confused by all the tumult,
so that while they thought they saw, in reality they only
heard the clamor of the marchers around them. In translation,
Mutanabbi's verses lose all value. Deprived of their
Arabic melody they seem mere bombast and absurdity.
This, in fact, is the general charge which must be made
against the later Arabic poetry. It too often degenerated into
empty sound.</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> name "Moor" is used loosely to describe all those
peoples who sprang from the mingling of the Berber,
or Hamitic, stock of North Africa, with the Arabs or Semitic
stock who swept over the region in the Mohammedan
conquest. The chief achievement of this mixed or Moorish
race was the establishment of their brilliant kingdom and
independent caliphate in Spain. Under the most powerful
of these Spanish caliphs, Ahderrahman III. (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 912-961),
their capital Cordova had six hundred mosques, including its
still celebrated chief mosque, the most beautiful building of
that age in Europe. The Moorish kingdom of Spain had
then seventeen universities and over seventy large libraries.
It was the most cultured land of Europe, the goal of scholars
from less peaceful and less learned Christendom.</p>

<p>The Moorish kingdom in the course of the twelfth century
broke up into many tiny States. These soon fought among
themselves and plunged each other into a common ruin.
African Moors, of far more ignorant and fanatic type, came
to aid their Spanish brethren; and under the pressure of
these barbarians, culture rapidly declined. The universities
were broken up. The great scholar Averroes, who had been
the pride of his nation, was accused of heresy. His teachings
were found not sufficiently subservient to the Koran; and
finally, in 1195, he was driven into exile. This event, or
Averroes' death soon afterward, may be reckoned as marking
the downfall of the Moorish leadership in science and
philosophy.</p>

<p>In our volume we give some of Averroes' most celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
commentaries, as typifying the culmination of Moorish culture.
We give also, as its opening note, the speech with
which Tarik, the first conqueror of Spain, in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 711
led his army to cross the Straits of Gibraltar and began the
attack upon the earlier Christian inhabitants. This speech
does not, however, preserve the actual words of Tarik; it
only presents the tradition of them as preserved by the
Moorish historian Al Maggari, who wrote in Africa long
after the last of the Moors had been driven out of Spain. In
Al Maggari's day the older Arabic traditions of exact service
had quite faded. The Moors had become poets and dreamers
instead of scientists and critical historians. The very name
of Al Maggari's history may be accepted as typifying its
character. He called it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> "Breath of Perfumes."</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHTS</h4>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">By Averroes</span>)</p>

<p>The first to preach the resurrection were the prophets of
Israel after Moses, then the Evangelical Christians, then the
Sabians, whose religion has been called by Ibn-Hazm the oldest
in the world. The reason so many founders of religion
established this dogma was because they supposed this belief
would moralize men and induce them to be virtuous in their
own interests. I do not quarrel with Al Ghazali or Motecallemin
for saying that the soul is immortal, but I object to the
idea that the soul is a mere accident, and that a man can take
again the body which has fallen into decay. No, he may take
another, similar to the first, but that which has been dead can
not return to life. These two bodies are only one, viewed
as a species, but they are two in number. Aristotle has said
in the last lines of his "Generation and Corruption": "A
body once corrupted can never become the same again; it
can never return as an individual whole, but it can return
to the specific variety of which it is a part. When air separates
from water or water separates from air, each of these
substances can not become again the thing it was, but must
return to its own species."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How have we come to adopt these tales of the creation?
Through habit. Just as a man inured to poison can take it
with impunity, so a man used to them from childhood can
accept the most unbelievable opinions. Therefore the opinions
of the masses are only formed through habit. The people
believe that which they hear incessantly repeated. And
that is why the power of religion is so much stronger than
that of philosophy, for it is not accustomed to hearing the
opposite of its belief, a thing which happens very often to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
philosophy: So one sees frequently, nowadays, men who,
having entered suddenly into the study of the speculative sciences,
lose the religious beliefs which they have only held
through habit, and become <i>zendihs</i> (infidels).</p>

<p>The religion sacred to philosophers is to study that which
<i>is</i>, for the most sublime worship one can render to God is the
recognition and knowledge of his works, which leads us to
know him, himself, in all his <i>reality</i>. In the eyes of God
that is the noblest action, while the vilest action is to tax with
error and presumption those who practise this worship, higher
than any other, who adore him by this religion, the best of all
religions.</p>

<p>Among the most dangerous of these fictions concerning a
future life are those which counsel virtue as a means of arriving
at happiness. In that case virtue is no longer worth
anything, since one only abstains from voluptuousness in the
hope of being doubly repaid in the future. The brave will
only seek death to evade a worse evil. The good will only
respect the belongings of others in order to acquire twice as
much.</p>

<p>Wine is forbidden because it excites wickedness and
quarrels; but I am preserved from those excesses by wisdom:
I take it only to sharpen my wits.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>That renegade philosopher, Al Ghazali, has gathered up
all he learned from the writings of the philosophers, and has
turned against them the arms he borrowed from them.</p>

<p>As for us, the philosophers, at the risk of exposing ourselves
to the rage of the persecutors of philosophy, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
our mother, we will, when the time is ripe, uncover the poison
hidden in Al Ghazali's book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our social state does not bring out all the resources and
possibilities there are in women; it would seem that they are
only destined to bear and rear children, and this state of servitude
has destroyed in them the capability for larger things.
That is why one never sees, with us, a woman possessed of
the moral virtues—their lives pass like those of flowers,
and they are a burden upon their husbands. From this
comes also the misery which devours our cities, for there
are twice as many women there as men, but the former are
not permitted to work for their own support.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My father aided in rescuing from prison Ibn Badja, who
was accused of heresy. My father does not understand that
his own son will one day be regarded as a far worse heretic.</p>

<p>God alone knows if I am one; but it is absolutely certain
that it was only the intrigues of my enemies which led to
my condemnation. I thought only of editing Aristotle and
establishing accord between religion and philosophy.</p>


<h4>TARIK'S ADDRESS TO HIS SOLDIERS</h4>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">From the History of Al Maggari</span>)</p>

<p>When Tarik had been informed of the approach of the
enemy, he rose in the midst of his companions and, after having
glorified God in the highest, he spoke to his soldiers thus:</p>

<p>"Oh my warriors, whither would you flee? Behind you
is the sea, before you, the enemy. You have left now only
the hope of your courage and your constancy. Remember
that in this country you are more unfortunate than the orphan
seated at the table of the avaricious master. Your
enemy is before you, protected by an innumerable army; he
has men in abundance, but you, as your only aid, have your
own swords, and, as your only chance for life, such chance
as you can snatch from the hands of your enemy. If the
absolute want to which you are reduced is prolonged ever so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
little, if you delay to seize immediate success, your good fortune
will vanish, and your enemies, whom your very presence
has filled with fear, will take courage. Put far from you
the disgrace from which you flee in dreams, and attack this
monarch who has left his strongly fortified city to meet you.
Here is a splendid opportunity to defeat him, if you will
consent to expose yourselves freely to death. Do not believe
that I desire to incite you to face dangers which I shall refuse
to share with you. In the attack I myself will be in the
fore, where the chance of life is always least.</p>

<p>"Remember that if you suffer a few moments in patience,
you will afterward enjoy supreme delight. Do not imagine
that your fate can be separated from mine, and rest assured
that if you fall, I shall perish with you, or avenge you. You
have heard that in this country there are a large number of
ravishingly beautiful Greek maidens, their graceful forms are
draped in sumptuous gowns on which gleam pearls, coral, and
purest gold, and they live in the palaces of royal kings. The
Commander of True Believers, Alwalid, son of Abdalmelik,
has chosen you for this attack from among all his Arab warriors;
and he promises that you shall become his comrades and
shall hold the rank of kings in this country. Such is his confidence
in your intrepidity. The one fruit which he desires
to obtain from your bravery is that the word of God shall be
exalted in this country, and that the true religion shall be
established here. The spoils will belong to yourselves.</p>

<p>"Remember that I place myself in the front of this glorious
charge which I exhort you to make. At the moment when
the two armies meet hand to hand, you will see me, never
doubt it, seeking out this Roderick, tyrant of his people, challenging
him to combat, if God is willing. If I perish after
this, I will have had at least the satisfaction of delivering
you, and you will easily find among you an experienced hero,
to whom you can confidently give the task of directing you.
But should I fall before I reach to Roderick, redouble your
ardor, force yourselves to the attack and achieve the conquest
of this country, in depriving him of life. With him dead, his
soldiers will no longer defy you."</p>

<p class="half-title">POETRY OF THE SPANISH MOORS</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">While</span> the scientific leadership of the Moors faded with
the breaking of their military unity in the twelfth century,
they still retained in some of their smaller kingdoms,
and especially in that of Granada, a high degree of culture.
The love of beauty and the spirit of romance were strong
among all the Spanish Moors; and so their poetry continued
long after science failed them. Poetry indeed became their
main expression. Granada, the last of all their Spanish
kingdoms, did not fall before the advancing Christians until
1492. Then, as our histories have so often told, Ferdinand
and Isabella, the Christian rulers of Spain, conducted a
holy war for the destruction of Granada. Its last fortress
surrendered, and its people withdrew to Africa. There, according
to a characteristically dreamy legend, they still retain
the keys of their mansions in Granada, treasuring them
up for the day of their triumphant return.</p>

<p>Of the Moorish poetry which survived the fall of Granada,
much was preserved by the Spaniards themselves and in the
Spanish language. The victors knew how to value the spirit
of the vanquished; and ballads of Moorish origin, telling of
Moorish loves, long remained popular in Spain. The authors
of most of these have been forgotten. The text of some
of the best known of them is given here.</p>

<p class="half-title">LEGEND AND POETRY AMONG THE TURKS</p>

<h4>(INTRODUCTION)</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Turkish</span> literature, as pointed out in our general introduction,
is of a less advanced character than that of
most of the Semitic literatures from which it is sprung. An
epigrammatic summary of the Turkish character has said that
every fourth word of Turkish is Arabic, every third idea
Persian, and every second impulse Mohammedan. This,
while not seeming to leave much of the original Turk, is perhaps
not an unfair estimate of the extent of the Turks' indebtedness
to the earlier races and religion upon which their
civilization is built.</p>

<p>The Ottoman Turks, that is, the Turks who founded the
present Turkish Empire, were a Tartar or Turanian tribe
from Central Asia who adopted the Mohammedan faith and
began their conquest of the Mohammedan world about the
year 1300. They then possessed legends or childish tales of
their own which still survive; and these are still told among
the mass of the people with simple faith. One or two of
these are given here, to show the natural human character of
the race.</p>

<p>The Turks next turned, in literature, to poetry. Persian
Mohammedan poetry was then at its best; and the Turks imitated,
but scarcely improved upon, its forms. So great, indeed,
became the Turkish admiration for poetry that almost
every Turkish Sultan, from the year fourteen hundred down
to the present, has written poetry. Our book gives a series, by
themselves, of the best of these royal poems.</p>

<p>Turkish poetry has chiefly followed the Arabic fashion of
expending itself upon language rather than upon thought.
We are told that when the first Turkish epic poet Ahmedi
presented to Sultan Bajazet's son his long epic history of
Alexander the Great, the prince rebuked the poet's years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
labor, saying that one tiny, perfectly polished poem would
have been worth more than all the epic. Hence it is chiefly to
the polishing of tiny poems that the poetic genius of the Turks
has been applied. They have a favorite form called the
"gazel," which might be likened to our English sonnet, except
that the gazel is by far more intricate. It is, in fact,
compared by the Turks to a flower with its petals constantly
overlapping, forming a circle, and ending at the point where
they began. In rhyme, for instance, the gazel opens with a
rhyming couplet, and then through the whole poem the second
line of each couplet repeats this opening rhyme.</p>

<p>We have tried to give the chief Turkish poets in somewhat
chronological order, beginning with their first poet Ashiq,
who died in 1332 and whose very name is forgotten, since
<i>ashiq</i> means merely "the lover." In other words, Turkish
poetry begins with the passion of an unknown lover, not apparently
for woman, but for life and God. The collected
poems of Ashiq are called a <i>divan</i>, the usual Persian and
Turkish word for such collections; but very little of the <i>divan</i>
of Ashiq has survived.</p>

<p>Among Turkish epic poets, the earliest is Ahmedi (died
1412), who wrote the Book of Alexander the Great. The
first romantic song is that of Sheykhi (1426) on the loves of
the maiden Shirin. The first religious epic is that of Yaziji-Oglu
(1449), called the "Book of Mohammed." These,
then, were the early singers. Of poets accounted of the highest
rank, the earliest was Nejati (1508). Lamii was the
scholar poet, a dervish or monk who delved into the older
Persian literature and drew his themes perhaps from ancient
Zoroastrian tales. He is usually named as the second greatest
of Turkish poets. Gazali, Fuzuli, and Nabi were also
noted singers of the sixteenth century, which was the great
age of the Turkish Empire, both in literature and in military
glory.</p>

<p>Of the two poetesses on our list, Mihri has been called the
Turkish Sappho. Yet as the life of a Turkish woman of
rank is carefully secluded, no scandal ever attached to her
personal life. Her poems are mere dreams of fancy. Zeyneb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
was equally honored, a lady of high rank and a student
of the Persian and Arabic poets.</p>

<p>All other singers, however, are accounted by the Turks inferior
to the great lyric poet Baqi (1526-1600). Baqi was
at first a saddler, but he studied law and rose to the highest
legal position of the empire. Poetry was the avocation of
the great lawyer's leisure, and it won him the admiring friendship
of the four successive Sultans who reigned during his
life. The very name Baqi means "that which lasts," or "the
enduring," so it has been frequently punned upon. The poet
himself used a seal with a Persian couplet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Fleeting is the world, and without faith</div>
  <div class="verse">God alone endures (or, Baqi alone is god); all else is fleeting"</div>

<p class="half-title">OLD TURKISH TALES</p>
<hr class="small" />
<h4>THE QUEEN OF NIGHT</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was an old man who had three
daughters. All of them were beautiful, but the youngest,
whose name was Rosa, was not only more lovely, but also
more amiable and more intelligent than the others. Jealous
and envious exceedingly were the two sisters when they found
that the fame of Rosa's beauty was greater than the fame of
theirs. They, however, refused to believe that Rosa was
really more lovely than they were, and they resolved to ask
the Sun's opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>So, one day at dawn, the sisters stood at their open window
and cried, "Sun, shining Sun, who wanderest all over the
world, say who is the most beautiful among our father's
daughters?"</p>

<p>The Sun replied, "I am beautiful, and you are both beautiful;
but your youngest sister is the most beautiful of all."</p>

<p>When the two girls heard this, they were beside themselves
with anger and spite, and determined to get rid of the sister
who so outshone them. Saying nothing to her of what the
Sun had told them, they on the following day invited Rosa to
accompany them to the wood to gather a salad of wild herbs
for their father's dinner. The unsuspecting Rosa at once
complied, took her basket, and set out with her sisters, who
led her to a spot she had never before visited, a long way
from her father's house, and surrounded on all sides by
forest. When they were arrived, the eldest sister said,</p>

<p>"Do thou, Rosa, gather all the herbs that are here; we
will go a little farther on, and when we have filled our baskets
we will return."</p>

<p>The wicked girls, however, went straight home, abandoning
Rosa to her fate. When some hours had passed, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
found that they did not return, she feared that she might,
while seeking for the herbs, have wandered from the spot
where her sisters had left her. Too innocent to suspect them
of the wicked treachery of which they had been guilty, she
only blamed herself for her carelessness, and wept bitterly at
the thought of remaining all night alone in the wild and
lonely wood.</p>

<p>After a time the sun set, the twilight came and passed, and
darkness fell. The birds ceased their songs, and the silence
of the forest was broken only by the flutter of a bat or great
gray moth, the melancholy hoot of an owl, and the faint little
rustle made by the other flying and creeping things that come
forth with the stars. Seated on a great tree-trunk, Rosa
wept more and more bitterly as the darkness deepened, and
no one came to her aid. Hours passed, the air grew chilly;
and faint with hunger and cold, she was about to lay herself
down to die, when suddenly a brilliant light, like the sparkling
of many stars, shot through the wood and advanced toward
the spot where she sat. It was the Queen of Night, who, attended
by all her court, was returning to her palace after her
usual journey, for it was now near dawn. Rosa, dazzled and
frightened, covered her face with her hands, and wept more
bitterly than ever. Attracted by the sound of her sobbing,
the Radiant Lady approached the weeping girl, and in a kind
and gentle voice asked how she came to be there. Rosa
looked up, and, reassured by the benign countenance of the
Queen of Night, told her story.</p>

<p>"Come then and live with me, dear girl; I will be your
mother, and you shall be my daughter," said the Queen, who
knew perfectly well how it had all happened.</p>

<p>Gladly the poor girl accompanied the Queen to her palace,
and being, as we know, as amiable and intelligent as she was
beautiful, her protectress soon became very fond of her, and
did everything in her power to make her adopted daughter
happy. She gave Rosa the keys of all her treasures, made
her the mistress of her palace, and let her do whatever she
pleased.</p>

<p>But let us now leave this lucky girl with the Queen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Night for a little while, and return to her sisters. Though
they fully believed she must either have perished of hunger
or been devoured by wild beasts, they after a time, to make
quite certain, went again to their window and cried,</p>

<p>"Sun, shining Sun, who wanderest all over the world,
tell us who is the most beautiful of our father's daughters?"</p>

<p>The Sun replied as before, "I am beautiful, and you are
both beautiful; but your youngest sister is the most beautiful
of all."</p>

<p>"But Rosa has long been dead!"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Sun, "Rosa still lives, and she is in the
palace of the Queen of Night."</p>

<p>When the sisters heard this, their rage and spite knew no
bounds. Long they consulted together as to the best means
of bringing about her death; and finally these wicked girls
decided to obtain from a witch of their acquaintance an enchanted
kerchief which would make the person wearing it appear
to be dead.</p>

<p>Well, they set out, and presently arrived at the palace at
an hour when they knew that the Queen of Night would be
absent and they might find their sister alone. Rosa was delighted
to see them, for though they had often been unkind to
her, she loved her sisters very dearly, and welcoming them
warmly, she offered them everything she had, and pressed
them to remain. They, on their part, pretended to be overjoyed
at finding again the sister they had mourned as lost,
and congratulated her on her good fortune. When they had
eaten and drunk of the good things she set before them, and
were about to take their departure, the eldest sister produced
from her basket the enchanted kerchief.</p>

<p>"Here, dear Rosa," said she, "is a little present which we
should like you to wear for our sakes. Let me pin it round
your shoulders. Good-bye, dear!" she added, kissing her
affectionately on both cheeks, "we will come and see you
again before long and bring our father with us."</p>

<p>"Do, dear sisters, and tell my dear father that I will go to
see him as soon as my kind protectress may give me leave."</p>

<p>Rosa watched her sisters from the window till they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
out of sight, and then turned to the embroidery-frame which
she had laid aside on their arrival. She had not, however,
made many stitches, before a feeling of faintness came over
her; and letting her work slip from her hands, she fell back
on the sofa and lost consciousness. When the Queen of
Night came home, she went first, as was her wont, to the
chamber of her dear adopted daughter, and finding her thus,
she said, as she bent over the maiden and kissed her beautiful
mouth, "She has tired herself, poor child, over that embroidery-frame;
she is so industrious."</p>

<p class="heading">THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_fp265.jpg" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But the beautiful lips were cold and white, and the maiden
neither breathed nor stirred. Distracted with grief, the
Queen of Night began to unfasten Rosa's dress in order to
ascertain whether her death had been caused by the bite of
some poisonous reptile, and while doing so, she observed that
the kerchief on her shoulders was not one that her daughter
was in the habit of wearing. When she had unpinned and
taken it off, Rosa heaved a deep sigh, opened her eyes, and
seeing the Queen bending over her, smiled and stretched out
her arms to her dear mother, saying,</p>

<p>"I must have slept a long time! Oh, I remember!" she
added, "I was feeling faint and giddy and lay down, and,
I suppose, fell asleep immediately, for I don't recollect anything
else."</p>

<p>"But where did you get this?" asked the Queen, picking
up the kerchief from the floor. "I don't remember having
given it to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have not told you that I had a great pleasure yesterday.
My sisters, who had thought me forever lost, found
out where I was and came to see me, bringing this kerchief as
a present. Is it not pretty?"</p>

<p>These words told the Queen of Night the secret of the
whole matter; but, not wishing to distress her daughter by acquainting
her with her sisters' cruel perfidy, she only replied,
"Yes, very pretty. Will you give it to me, Rosa? I should
like to have it for myself."</p>

<p>Rosa was naturally only too pleased to be able to give her
kind protectress something in return for all her favors; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
she also promised her, though not without tears, never again to
receive any visitors, not even her sisters, when she was left
by herself in the palace.</p>

<p>These wicked creatures in a little while again stood at their
window and cried, "Sun, shining Sun, who wanderest the
world over, say, is there now any one more beautiful than
we are?"</p>

<p>But the Sun only replied as before, "I am beautiful; you,
too, are beautiful; but Rosa is the most beautiful of all!"</p>

<p>The sisters looked at each other in dismay. "The kerchief
has then failed," said the elder to the younger. "We must
try some other method of getting rid of her."</p>

<p>So the wretches went to the same old witch who had given
them the magic kerchief, and got from her an enchanted sugar-plum.
When at nightfall they again knocked at the door of
the palace, the porter informed them that his mistress was
absent, and had given orders that the palace-gates were not to
be opened until her return. They, however, saw Rosa at her
window, and pretending to be greatly distressed at their
exclusion, asked her at least to accept from them the delicious
sugar-plum which they had brought for her.</p>

<p>"Let down a basket," said the eldest; "I will put the sugar-plum
inside, and you can draw it up."</p>

<p>Rosa did so, and drew up the sweetmeat.</p>

<p>"Taste it at once," cried the second sister, "and if you
like it, we will bring you more of the same kind."</p>

<p>The poor girl, suspecting no evil, put the sugar-plum into
her mouth; but scarcely had she tasted it, than she fell back
as if dead; and her sisters, seeing this, hurried away home.</p>

<p>When the Queen returned and again found her favorite
lifeless, she was both grieved and angry. All her servants,
however, when questioned, assured her that no one had
entered the palace during her absence, and that Rosa's sisters
had only been allowed to speak to her from a distance as
she stood at her high window. In the hope of bringing her
to life again, as on the previous occasion, the Queen of Night
searched every fold of the maiden's dress, but in vain; she
could not discover the fatal charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," said she to herself, as she sat and gazed on the
lifeless features of her adopted daughter, "what I can not
discover, chance may, and I could never bring myself to bury
her, dead though she seems to be."</p>

<p>So the grieving Queen sent for a cunning workman, who
made at her orders a coffer of silver; and after dressing Rosa
in her most beautiful clothes and jewels, she laid her in it,
closed the lid, fastened the coffer on the back of a splendid
horse, and let him loose to wander at will.</p>

<p>The horse, following his fancy, carried his fair burden in
a few hours' time into a neighboring country, the ruler of
which was the handsomest man of his time; and this King,
being that day out hunting with his court, happened to catch
sight of the horse. Attracted by its beauty and fleetness, and
by the strange shining burden it bore on its saddle, he approached,
and seeing the animal to be masterless, he bade his
people seize and lead it to the palace. The silver coffer the
King caused to be carried into his bed-chamber, and there he
opened it. Imagine, if you can, his surprise on seeing within
the form of a beautiful maiden. Though apparently lifeless,
she was more lovely than any living woman he had ever beheld,
and his heart became filled with such ardent love for
her that he would sit for hours together gazing upon her beautiful
features, neglecting duties and pleasures alike; and
when his ministers came and prayed him to accompany them
to the council chamber, he only said,</p>

<p>"Go, I pray you, and do justice in my name."</p>

<p>Days passed, his gentlemen tried to tempt him out hunting,
but again he only replied,</p>

<p>"Do you go without me."</p>

<p>The royal cooks vied with one another in preparing the
most delicious dishes for his table; but these he hardly tasted,
nor did he even appear to notice what he was eating. When
this state of things had continued for some days the ministers
became alarmed, and sent a messenger to inform the Queen-Mother,
who was away at her country palace. She came with
all speed, and was much distressed to find her son so
dispirited and melancholy. To all her anxious inquiries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
however, he only replied that he was quite well, but preferred
to remain alone in his bed-chamber. The Queen had, of
course, already heard from the courtiers the story of the riderless
horse and the silver chest; and she rightly guessed that
her son had been bewitched by what he had found in it, and
determined to discover what this might be.</p>

<p>So the very next day, while the King was at dinner with
his vizier, his mother went to his chamber—for she had a
master-key that would open all the doors in the palace—and
there, extended on the divan, she saw the silver chest. Going
hastily up to it, she raised the lid which the King had closed
before leaving. At first she could only gaze in astonishment
at the wonderful beauty of the maiden lying within; but her
admiration presently changed to anger when she thought of
her son; and seizing poor Rosa by her long hair, she dragged
her out of the coffer and shook her violently, saying,</p>

<p>"You wicked dead thing! Why are you not decently
buried instead of wandering about casting spells on Princes?"
But as the Queen shook her the enchanted sugar-plum was
jerked out of Rosa's mouth, and she immediately came to life
again, and gazed around her in bewilderment. And as she
opened her large, lovely eyes, the Queen's anger passed away,
and she embraced and kissed Rosa tenderly, weeping with delight
the while. The poor girl was so astonished by the
strangeness of everything around her, that it was some minutes
before she could ask:</p>

<p>"Where am I, noble lady, and where is my dear mother?"</p>

<p>"I know not, my child, but I will be your mother. For
you shall marry my son, the King, who is dying for love of
you."</p>

<p>As she spoke, footsteps were heard at the door, and the
King entered. Imagine, if you can, his amazement and joy
at finding, seated on the divan by his mother's side, the maiden
he loved so dearly, restored to life, and twenty times lovelier
than before. Not to make too long a story of it, the King
took her by the hand, and asked her to be his wife. And
when Rosa heard of his love for her, and saw how handsome
and noble he was, she could not but love him in return. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
they were married with great splendor, and there were feasts
for the poor, and fountains running honey and wine, and rejoicings
for everybody.</p>

<p>Well, the King and Rosa lived very happily together for
some time; but her troubles were not over, for her wicked
sisters had not yet done their worst to her. They had for
long feared to go near the palace again, and nearly a year
passed before they learned what had been the result of their
last visit. One day, however, in order to make quite sure
that Rosa was dead, they once more stood at their window,
and cried,</p>

<p>"Sun, shining Sun, who wanderest all over the earth, tell
us if thou hast, since our youngest sister died, seen any maiden
fairer than we?"</p>

<p>But the Sun only replied as before, "I am beautiful; you,
too, are both beautiful; but your youngest sister is the fairest
of all."</p>

<p>"But Rosa is dead!"</p>

<p>"No, Rosa lives, and she is the wife of the King of the
neighboring country."</p>

<p>Well, if these wicked women could not bear that their sister
should be considered fairer than they, still less could they
allow her to be a Queen. So, disguised as two old women,
they set off at once for Rosa's palace. When they arrived in
the royal city, great rejoicings were going on because a baby
prince had just been born.</p>

<p>"That is good news," said the elder to the younger when
she heard this, "for now we will be the nurses." So they
went to the Queen-Mother and gave themselves out to be wonderfully
clever nurses from the neighboring country who had
nursed the princes there; and the Queen-Mother, deceived by
their story, put them in charge of her daughter-in-law and
the baby. On the pretext of keeping the young Queen and
her child free from evil spells, the make-believe nurses sent
away all the other attendants from her apartments; and when
they were left alone with their sister, they stack into her head
an enchanted pin.</p>

<p>She was immediately changed into a bird, and flew away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
out of the window; and her eldest sister laid herself down on
her bed in her place.</p>

<p>When the King came in to see his wife, he could hardly
believe his eyes. This could not be his wife. The false
Queen, guessing his thoughts, said,</p>

<p>"You find me changed, dear husband? It is because I
have been so ill."</p>

<p>The King, however, pretended not to have observed anything,
but his heart froze within him as he looked on the object
of this pretended transformation.</p>

<p>It was his custom to breakfast alone every day in the
garden; and one day while he was sadly musing there, a pretty
bird flew down, perched on a branch overhead, and said,
"Tell me, my lord, have the King, and the Queen-Mother,
and the little Prince slept well?"</p>

<p>The King smiled and nodded, and the bird continued,
"May they ever sleep sweetly. But may she whom they call
the young Queen sleep the sleep that knows no waking, and
may all things over which I fly wither away!"</p>

<p>This said, the bird spread its wings, and wherever it passed,
the grass and flowers withered, and the place became a desert.
The gardeners, in despair, asked the King if they might not
kill the bird which caused the mischief; but he forbade them,
on pain of death, to do it any injury.</p>

<p>Afterward the bird came every day while he was at breakfast
in the garden; and the kind voice of the Prince soon made
it so tame and fearless that it would perch on his knee and
eat from his hand. This familiarity enabled the Prince to
observe the bird's plumage more closely, and one day he
caught sight of the pin in its head. Surprised at this, he ventured
to withdraw it, when the bird disappeared, and his own
dear wife stood again by his side. When he had recovered a
little from the joy and surprise caused by this strange event,
and had welcomed his wife back, he asked her to tell how it
had all happened. And Rosa, whose eyes were now fully
opened to the malice and wickedness of her sisters, told him
all she knew of her own adventures.</p>

<p>When the Prince had learned the evil deeds of his sisters-in-law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
he bade his guards bring these wretches before him,
and condemned them both to a death suitable to their crimes.
In vain did Rosa entreat him to pardon them. The King was
inexorable. But when, at sunset, the criminals were being
led away to execution, the Queen of Night appeared on the
scene, followed by all her train; and touched by the distress
of her adopted daughter, she prevailed upon the King to
change the sentence he had pronounced. The two evil-doers
were then offered the choice of dying a violent death, or living
to witness their sister's happiness while deprived of the power
of ever again being able to injure her.</p>

<p>They chose the latter fate; and it was not long before they
both died of spite and jealousy.</p>

  <div class="verse">The hyacinths o'er the narcissi rested.</div>
  <div class="verse">When shone her day-face, from that musky cloud bare,</div>
  <div class="verse">Her eyes oped Shirin and beheld the King there.</div>

  <div class="verse">Hither come, O seeker after Truth! if joy thou wouldest share,</div>
  <div class="verse">Enter on the Mystic Pathway, follow it, then joy thou'lt share.</div>
  <div class="verse">Harken now what God (exalted high his name!) from naught hath formed.</div>
  <div class="verse">Eden's bower he hath created; Light, its lamp, he did prepare;</div>
  <div class="verse">Loftiest its sites, and best and fairest are its blest abodes;</div>
  <div class="verse">Midst of each a hall of pearls—not ivory nor teak-wood rare.</div>
  <div class="verse">Each pavilion he from seventy ruddy rubies raised aloft—</div>
  <div class="verse">Dwellings these in which the dwellers sit secure from fear or care.</div>
  <div class="verse">Bound within each courtyard seventy splendid houses he hath ranged,</div>
  <div class="verse">Formed of emeralds green—houses these no fault of form that bear.</div>
  <div class="verse">There, within each house, are seventy pearl and gem-incrusted thrones;</div>
  <div class="verse">He upon each throne hath stretched out seventy couches broidered fair;</div>
  <div class="verse">Sits on every couch a maiden of the bourne of loveliness:</div>
  <div class="verse">Moons their foreheads, days their faces, each a jeweled crown doth wear;</div>
  <div class="verse">Wine their rubies, soft their eyes, their eyebrows troublous, causing woe:</div>
  <div class="verse">All-enchanting, Paradise pays tribute to their witching air.</div>
  <div class="verse">Sudden did they see the faces of those damsels dark of eye,</div>
  <div class="verse">Blinded sun and moon were, and Life's Stream grew bitter then and there.</div>
  <div class="verse">Thou wouldst deem that each was formed of rubies, corals, and of pearls;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
  <div class="verse">Question there is none, for God thus in the Koran doth declare.</div>
  <div class="verse">Tables seventy, fraught with bounties, he in every house hath placed,</div>
  <div class="verse">And on every tray hath spread out seventy sorts of varied fare.</div>
  <div class="verse">All these glories, all these honors, all these blessings of delight,</div>
  <div class="verse">All these wondrous mercies surely for his sake he did prepare:</div>
  <div class="verse">Through his love unto Mohammed, he the universe hath framed;</div>
  <div class="verse">Happy, for his sake, the naked and the hungry enter there.</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">O Thou Perfectness of Potence! O Thou God of Awful Might!</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">O Thou Majesty of Glory! O Thou King of Perfect Eight!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Since he Eden's heaven created, all is there complete and whole,</div>
  <div class="verse">So that naught is lacking; nothing he created needs repair.</div>
  <div class="verse">Yonder, for his righteous servants, things so fair hath he devised,</div>
  <div class="verse">That no eye hath e'er beheld them; ope thy soul's eye, on them stare.</div>
  <div class="verse">Never have his servants heard them, neither can their hearts conceive;</div>
  <div class="verse">Reach unto their comprehension shall this understanding ne'er.</div>
  <div class="verse">There that God a station lofty, of the loftiest, hath reared,</div>
  <div class="verse">That unclouded station he the name Vesila caused to bear,</div>
  <div class="verse">That to his Belovèd yonder station a dear home may be,</div>
  <div class="verse">Thence ordained is Heaven's order free from every grief and care.</div>
  <div class="verse">In its courtyard's riven center, planted he the Tuba-Tree;</div>
  <div class="verse">That a tree which hangeth downward, high aloft its roots are there:</div>
  <div class="verse">Thus its radiance all the Heavens lighteth up from end to end,</div>
  <div class="verse">Flooding every tent and palace, every lane and every square.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>

  <div class="verse">Golden leaves and clearest crystals, wines most pure beyond compare.</div>
  <div class="verse">For his sake there into being hath he called the Tuba-Tree,</div>

<h4>THE MIRROR OF COUNTRIES</h4>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Introduction by Professor Arminius Vambery</span>)</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> book of the Turkish Admiral Sidi Ali Reis, entitled
"<i>Mirat ul Memalik</i>" (the Mirror of Countries), is in
many ways interesting. In the first place, on account of
the personality of the author, in whom we see a man of many
varied accomplishments; a genuine type of the Islamitic culture
of his time, and a representative of that class of official
and military dignitaries to whose influence it is chiefly due
that the Ottoman Empire, extending over three continents,
attained to that eminent height of culture which it occupied
during the reign of Suleiman the Great. Sidi Ali is the
descendant of an illustrious family connected with the arsenal
at Galata, in whom love for the sea seems to have been hereditary,
and hence, as the Turkish publisher points out in his
preface, Sidi Ali, being thoroughly acquainted with the nautical
science of his day, excels as author on maritime subjects.</p>

<p>As a man of general culture, he was in harmony with the
prevailing notions of his time, as mathematician, astronomer,
and geographer; and also as poet, theologian, and in all
branches of general literature; sometimes wielding his pen in
writing lyrical or occasional verses, at other times entering
into keen controversial disputes upon certain Koran theses or
burning schismatic questions.</p>

<p>Besides all this he was a warrior, proving himself as undaunted
in fighting the elements as in close combat with the
Portuguese, who in point of accoutrement had far the advantage
over him. But what stands out above all these accomplishments
is his glowing patriotism and his unwavering faith
in the power and the greatness of the Ottoman Empire. He
boasts that he never ceases to hope to see Gujarat and Ormuz
joined to the Ottoman realm; his one desire is to see his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Padishah ruler of the world, and wherever he goes and whatever
he sees, Rum (Turkey) always remains in his eyes the most
beautiful, the richest, and the most cultured land of the whole
world. The Turkish Admiral has, moreover, a singularly
happy way of expressing himself on this subject of his preference
for his own Padishah and his native land; and this required
no small amount of courage and tact where he had to
face proud Humayun or Thamasp, no less conceited than the
former.</p>

<p>With regard to the things which he saw and heard in non-Mussulman
circles and districts in India, his accounts are
poor compared with the descriptions of Ibn Batuta and other
Moslem travelers. Sidi Ali has had hardly any intercourse
with Hindus, and his route lay almost entirely through districts
where the ruling caste, with whom he principally had
to deal, were adherents to the Mohammedan faith. It does
appear somewhat strange that he had such unbounded reverence
for the Sultan of Turkey, and upheld him as the legitimate
Caliph, although the caliphate had only fallen into the
hands of the Ottoman rulers a few years previously with the
overthrow of Tuman Bey by Selim II; and this seems the
more strange, as Asia is so tenaciously conservative that even
to this day the Turkish claim to the caliphate is a disputed
point.</p>

<p>The authoritative and executive power of Turkey, formerly
the terror of the Christian world, could not fail to exercise
its influence upon the Moslem lands of Asia and their unstable
governments, torn and harassed as they were by internal strife
and petty wars, while the sultans of Turkey basked, not only
in the glory of spiritual preferment, but also in that of temporal
superiority. The picture which our author draws of
the government of India and the East is certainly a very sad
one. Civil wars and mutinies against the rulers of the land
are every-day occurrences; the roads swarm with highwaymen,
and even during the reign of the much-extolled Humayun,
all intercourse with other lands was fraught with every
imaginable kind of danger. Their rulers all suffer from a
peculiar form of conceit, like the ruler of Bokhara,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span> "who
asked me, pointing to a ragged, motley crowd of ruffians,
whether the army of the Sultan of Turkey were not exactly
like this." Humayun, Thamasp, and even Borak Khan of
Bokhara, all delighted in drawing parallels between themselves
and Sultan Suleiman.</p>

<p>One thing, however, in the account of the Turkish Admiral
is certainly surprising, namely the few facts by which
he illustrates the Sultan's policy in Moslem Asia. We have
always been under the impression that the Turks, during the
era of their supreme power and universal sway, directed their
attention more toward the Christian lands of the West, than
toward the Moslem lands of the East, and that as a matter of
fact their campaigns were nothing short of marauding raids,
and empty conquests, while they might have utilized the many
means at their disposal and the high prestige in which they
stood toward the consolidation of their power in Asia, which
would have been comparatively easy. This reproach is
neither unfounded nor unmerited, for although the finest of
the Ottoman rulers, Sultan Selim, did direct his attention
chiefly toward the East, as proved by his campaigns against
Persia and Egypt, most of his predecessors and successors
have occupied themselves solely in making war in the West.
Asia, which offered little to tempt the mercenary janissaries,
was meanwhile left pretty well to its own devices, without any
fixed form or plan of government. But, as in this narrative
the threads of the policy pursued by those sultans, one by one,
come to light, we are struck with the fact that, after all,
they were not quite so short-sighted as we gave them credit
for, and that now and again they have given a thought to the
bringing about of a better state of things.</p>

<h4>THE MIRROR OF COUNTRIES<br />

OR<br />

THE ADVENTURES OF SIDI ALI REIS</h4>


<h5>I</h5>

<p>When Sultan Suleiman had taken up his winter residence
in Aleppo, I, the author of these pages, was appointed to the
Admiralship of the Egyptian fleet, and received instructions
to fetch back to Egypt the ships (15 galleys), which some
time ago had been sent to Basrah on the Persian Gulf. But,
"Man proposes, God disposes." I was unable to carry out
my mission, and as I realized the impossibility of returning by
water, I resolved to go back to Turkey by the overland route,
accompanied by a few tried and faithful Egyptian soldiers.
I traveled through Gujarat, Hind, Sind, Balkh, Zabulistan,
Bedakhshan, Khotlan, Turan, and Iran, <i>i.e.</i>, through Transoxania,
Khorassan, Kharezm, and Deskti-Kiptchak; and as
I could not proceed any farther in that direction, I went by
Meshed and the two Iraks, Kazwin and Hamadan, on to
Bagdad.</p>

<p>Our travels ended, my companions and fellow-adventurers
persuaded me to write down our experiences, and the dangers
through which we had passed, an accurate account of which it
is almost impossible to give; also to tell of the cities and the
many wonderful sights we had seen, and of the holy shrines
we had visited. And so this little book sees the light; in it
I have tried to relate, in simple and plain language, the
troubles and difficulties, the suffering and the distress which
beset our path, up to the time that we reached Constantinople.
Considering the matter it contains this book ought to have
been entitled, "A tale of woe," but with a view to the scene
of action I have called it "Mirror of Countries," and as such
I commend it to the reader's kind attention.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<h5>II<br />

THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY</h5>

<p>When the illustrious Padishah was holding his court at
Aleppo, in Ramazan of the year 960 (1552), I was commanded
to join the army.</p>

<p>I celebrated Ramzam-Bairam in attendance on his Majesty,
later on, however, I went to Sidi-Ghazi, made a pilgrimage
in Konia to the tomb of Molla-i-Rumi, and visited the shrines
of the Sultan ul-Ulema, and Shemsi Tebrizi, and of the
Sheik Sadr-ed-din-Koniavi; at Kassarie I made a pilgrimage
to the graves of the Sheiks Awhad-ed-din Kirmani,
Burham-ed-din, Baha-ed-din Zade, Ibrahim Akserayi, and
Davud Kaissari. Returned to Haleb (Aleppo), I visited
the graves of Daud, Zakeriah, and Balkiah, as also those of
Saad and Said, companions of the Prophet. The Kurban-Bairam
I spent again in attendance on the Sultan.</p>

<p>I must here mention that Piri Bey, the late Admiral of
the Egyptian fleet, had, some time previous to this, been dispatched
with about 30 ships (galleys and galleons) from Suez,
through the Red Sea, touching Jedda and Yemen, and through
the straits of Bab-i-Mandeb, past Aden and along the coast
of Shahar.<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Through fogs and foul weather his fleet became
dispersed, some ships were lost, and with the remainder he
proceeded from Oman to Muscat, took the fortress and made
all the inhabitants prisoners; he also made an incursion into
the islands of Ormuz and Barkhat, after which he returned to
Muscat. There he learned from the captive infidel captain
that the Christian (Portuguese) fleet was on its way, that
therefore any further delay was inadvisable, as in case it
arrived he would not be able to leave the harbor at all. As a
matter of fact it was already too late to save all the ships; he
therefore took only three, and with these just managed to
make his escape before the arrival of the Portuguese. One of
his galleys was wrecked near Bahrein, so he brought only two
vessels back to Egypt. As for the remainder of the fleet at
Basrah, Kubad Pasha had offered the command of it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
Chief Officer, but he had declined, and returned to Egypt by
land.</p>

<p>When this became known in Constantinople the command of
the fleet had been given to Murad Bey, formerly Sanjakbey
of Catif, then residing in Basrah. He was ordered to leave
two ships, five galleys, and one galleon at Basrah, and with
the rest, <i>i.e.</i>, 15 galleys (one galley had been burned in Basrah)
and two boats, he was to return to Egypt. Murad Bey
did start as arranged, but opposite Ormuz he came upon the
infidel (Portuguese) fleet, a terrible battle followed in which
Suleiman Reis, Rejeb Reis, and several of the men, died a
martyr's death. Many more were wounded and the ships
terribly battered by the cannon-balls. At last, night put a
stop to the fight. One boat was wrecked off the Persian coast,
part of the crew escaped, the rest were taken prisoners by the
infidels, and the boat itself captured.</p>

<p>When all this sad news reached the capital, toward the end
of Zilhija of the said year 960 (1552), the author of these
pages was appointed Admiral of the Egyptian fleet.</p>

<p>I, humble Sidi Ali bin Husein, also known as Kiatibi-Rumi
(the writer of the West, <i>i.e.</i>, of Turkey), most gladly accepted
the post. I had always been very fond of the sea, had taken
part in the expedition against Rhodes under the Sultan
(Suleiman), and had since had a share in almost all engagements,
both by land and by sea. I had fought under Khaireddin
Pasha, Sinan Pasha, and other captains, and had
cruised about on the Western (Mediterranean) sea, so that
I knew every nook and corner of it. I had written several
books on astronomy, nautical science, and other matters bearing
upon navigation. My father and grandfather, since the
conquest of Constantinople, had had charge of the arsenal<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
at Galata; they had both been eminent in their profession, and
their skill had come down to me as an heirloom.</p>

<p>The post now entrusted to me was much to my taste, and
I started from Aleppo for Basrah, on the first of Moharram<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
of the year 961 (7 Dec. 1553). I crossed the Euphrates at
Biredjik and when in Reka (<i>i.e.</i>, Orfah), I undertook a pilgrimage
to the tomb of Abraham, having visited on the way
between Nisebin and Mossul the holy graves of the prophets
Yunis and Djerdjis and of the sheiks Mohammed Garabili,
Feth Mosuli, and Kazib-elban-Mosuli. On the way to Bagdad
I made a little detour from Tekrit to Samira, and visited
the graves of Iman Ali-el-Hadi and Iman Haman Askeri,
after which I came past the towns of Ashik<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and Maashuk,
and through Harbi, past the castle of Semke, on to Bagdad.
We crossed the Tigris near Djisr and, after visiting the graves
of the saints there, I continued my journey past the fortress
of Teir, to Bire, and crossing the Euphrates near the little
town of Masib, I reached Kerbela (Azwie), where I made a
pilgrimage to the graves of the martyrs Hasan and Husein.
Turning into the steppe near Shefata, I reached Nedjef
(Haira) on the second day, and visited the graves of Adam,
Noah, Shimun, and Ali, and from there proceeded to Kufa,
where I saw the mosque with the pulpit under which the
prophets of the house of Ali are buried, and the tombs of
Kamber and Duldul. Arrived at the fortress of Hasinia, I
visited the grave of the prophet Zilkefl, the son of Aaron,
and in Hilla I made pilgrimages to the graves of Iman Mohammed
Mehdi and Iman Akil, brother of Ali, and also visited
there the mosque of Shem. Again crossing the Euphrates
(this time by a bridge), I resumed my journey to Bagdad
and went from there by ship to Basrah. On the way we
touched Medain, saw the grave of Selmas Faris, admired
Tak Kesri and the castle of Shah Zenan, and went past Imare
Bugazi, on the road of Vasit to Zekya, past the strongholds of
Adjul and Misra to Sadi-es Sueiba and on to Basrah, where
I arrived toward the end of Safar of the said year (beginning
of February, 1554).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>


<h5>III<br />

ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN BASRAH</h5>

<p>On the day after my arrival I had an interview with Mustafa
Pasha, who, after seeing my credentials, made over to
me the 15 galleys which were needing a great deal of repair.
As far as could be, they were put in order, calked and provided
with guns, which, however, were not to be had in sufficient
quantity either from the stores there or from Ormuz.
A water-supply had also to be arranged for, and as it was
yet five months before the time of the monsoon,<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> I had plenty
of leisure to visit the mosque of Ali and the graves of Hasan
Basri, Talha, Zobeir, Uns-bin-Malik, Abdurrahman-bin-Anf,
and several martyrs and companions of the Prophet. One
night I dreamed that I lost my sword, and as I remembered
that a similar thing had happened to Sheik Muhieddin and
had resulted in a defeat, I became greatly alarmed, and, just
as I was about to pray to the Almighty for the victory of the
Islam arms, I awoke. I kept this dream a secret, but it troubled
me for a long time, and when later on Mustafa Pasha
sent a detachment of soldiers to take the island of Huweiza
(in which expedition I took part with five of my galleys),
and the undertaking resulted in our losing about a hundred
men all through the fickleness of the Egyptian troops, I fully
believed this to be the fulfilment of my dream. But alas!
there was more to follow—for:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">What is decreed must come to pass,</div>
  <div class="verse">No matter, whether you are joyful or anxious.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When at last the time of the monsoon came, the Pasha sent
a trusty sailor with a frigate to Ormuz, to explore the neighborhood.
After cruising about for a month he returned with
the news that, except for four boats, there was no sign of any
ships of the infidels in those waters. The troops therefore
embarked and we started for Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>


<h5>IV<br />

WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE SEA OF ORMUZ</h5>

<p>On the first of Shawal we left the harbor of Basrah, accompanied,
as far as Ormuz, by the frigate of Sherifi Pasha.
We visited on the way from Mehzari the grave of Khidr, and
proceeding along the coast of Duspul (Dizful), and Shushter
in Charik, I made pilgrimages to the graves of Imam Mohammed,
Hanifi, and other saints.</p>

<p>From the harbor in the province of Shiraz we visited Rishehr
(Bushir) and after reconnoitering the coasts and unable
to get any clue as to the whereabouts of the enemy by means
of the <i>Tshekleva</i>,<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> I proceeded to Katif, situated near Lahsa<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
and Hadjar on the Arabian coast. Unable to learn anything
there, I went on to Bahrein, where I interviewed the commander
of the place, Reis Murad. But neither could he give
me any information about the fleet of the infidels. There is a
curious custom at Bahrein. The sailors, provided with a
leather sack, dive down into the sea and bring the fresh water
from the bottom for Reis Murad's use. This water is particularly
pleasant and cold in the spring time, and Reis Murad
gave me some. God's power is boundless! This custom is
the origin of the proverb: "<i>Maradj ul bahreia jaltakian</i>,"
and hence also the name "Bahrein."</p>

<p>Next we came to Kis, <i>i.e.</i>, old Ormuz, and Barhata, and
several other small islands in the Green Sea, <i>i.e.</i>, the waters
of Ormuz, but nowhere could we get any news of the fleet. So
we dismissed the vessel, which Mustafa Pasha had sent as an
escort, with the message that Ormuz was safely passed. We
proceeded by the coasts of Djilgar and Djadi, past the towns
of Keimzar or Leime, and forty days after our departure,
<i>i.e.</i>, on the tenth of Ramazan, in the forenoon, we suddenly
saw coming toward us the Christian fleet, consisting of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
large ships, three galleons, six Portuguese guard ships, and
twelve galleys (<i>Kalita</i>), 25 vessels in all. I immediately
ordered the canopy to be taken down, the anchor weighed,
the guns put in readiness, and then, trusting to the help of
the Almighty, we fastened the <i>filandra</i><a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> to the mainmast,
the flags were unfurled, and, full of courage and calling upon
Allah, we commenced to fight. The volley from the guns and
cannon was tremendous, and with God's help we sank and
utterly destroyed one of the enemy's galleons.</p>

<p>Never before within the annals of history has such a battle
been fought, and words fail me to describe it.</p>

<p>The battle continued till sunset, and only then the Admiral
of the infidel fleet began to show some signs of fear.
He ordered the signal-gun to fire a retreat, and the fleet
turned in the direction of Ormuz.</p>

<p>With the help of Allah, and under the lucky star of the
Padishah, the enemies of Islam had been defeated. Night
came at last; we were becalmed for awhile, then the wind
rose, the sails were set and as the shore was near ... until
daybreak. The next day we continued our previous course.
On the day after we passed Khorfakan,<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> where we took in
water, and soon after reached Oman, or rather Sohar.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Thus
we cruised about for nearly 17 days. When on the sixth of
Ramazan, <i>i.e.</i>, the day of Kadr-Ghedjesi, a night in the month
of Ramazan, we arrived in the vicinity of Maskat and Kalhat,<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
we saw in the morning, issuing from the harbor of
Maskat, 12 large boats and 22 <i>gurabs</i>, 34 vessels in all, commanded
by Captain Kuya,<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> the son of the Governor. They
carried a large number of troops.</p>

<p>The boats and galleons obscured the horizon with their
mizzen sails (<i>Magistra</i>)<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and <i>Peneta</i> (small sails) all set;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
the guard-ships spread their round sails (<i>Chember-yelken</i>),
and, gay with hunting, they advanced toward us. Full of confidence
in God's protection we awaited them. Their boats
attacked our galleys; the battle raged, cannon and guns,
arrows and swords made terrible slaughter on both sides.
The <i>Badjoalushka</i> penetrated the boats and the <i>Shaikas</i><a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
and tore large holes in their hulls, while our galleys were
riddled through by the javelins (<i>Darda</i>)<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> thrown down upon
us from the enemy's turrets, which gave them the appearance
of bristling porcupines; and they showered down upon us....</p>

<p>The stones which they threw at us created quite a whirlpool
as they fell into the sea.</p>

<p>One of our galleys was set on fire by a bomb, but strange
to say the boat from which it issued shared the like fate. God
is merciful! Five of our galleys and as many of the enemy's
boats were sunk and utterly wrecked, one of theirs went to
the bottom with all sails set. In a word, there was great loss
on both sides; our rowers were now insufficient in number to
manage the oars, while running against the current, and to fire
the cannon. We were compelled to drop anchor (at the
stern) and to continue to fight as best we might. The boats
had also to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Alemshah Reis, Kara Mustafa, and Kalfat Memi, captains
of some of the foundered ships, and Derzi Mustafa Bey, the
Serdar of the volunteers, with the remainder of the Egyptian
soldiers and 200 carpenters, had landed on the Arabian
shore, and as the rowers were Arabs they had been hospitably
treated by the Arabs of Nedjd.</p>

<p>The ships (<i>gurabs</i>) of the infidel fleet had likewise taken
on board the crews of their sunken vessels, and as there were
Arabs amongst them, they also had found shelter on the Arabian
coast. God is our witness. Even in the war between
Khaiveddin Pasha and Andreas Doria no such naval action as
this has ever taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>When night came, and we were approaching the bay of
Ormuz, the wind began to rise. The boats had already cast
two <i>Lenguvurta</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, large anchors,<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> the <i>Lushtas</i> were
tightly secured, and, towing the conquered <i>gurabs</i> along, we
neared the shore while the galleys, dragging their anchors,
followed. However, we were not allowed to touch the shore,
and had to set sail again. During that night we drifted away
from the Arabian coast into the open sea, and finally reached
the coasts of Djash,<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> in the province of Kerman. This is a
long coast, but we could find no harbor, and we roamed about
for two days before we came to Kichi Mekran.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>As the evening was far advanced we could not land immediately,
but had to spend another night at sea. In the morning
a dry wind carried off many of the crew, and at last, after
unheard-of troubles and difficulties, we approached the harbor
of Sheba.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>Here we came upon a <i>Notak</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a brigantine (pirate-ship),
laden with spoils, and when the watchman sighted us
they hailed us. We told them that we were Mussulmans,
whereupon their captain came on board our vessel; he kindly
supplied us with water, for we had not a drop left, and thus
our exhausted soldiers were invigorated. This was on Bairam
day, and for us, as we had now got water, a double feast-day.
Escorted by the said captain we entered the harbor of Guador.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
The people there were Beluchistanis and their chief
was Malik Djelaleddin, the son of Malik Dinar. The Governor
of Guador came on board our ship and assured us of his
unalterable devotion to our glorious Padishah. He promised
that henceforth, if at any time our fleet should come to Ormuz,
he would undertake to send 50 or 60 boats to supply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>us with provisions, and in every possible way to be of service
to us. We wrote a letter to the native Prince Djelaleddin to
ask for a pilot, upon which a first-class pilot was sent us, with
the assurance that he was thoroughly trustworthy and entirely
devoted to the interests of our Padishah.</p>


<h5>V<br />

WHAT WE SUFFERED IN THE INDIAN OCEAN</h5>

<p>God is merciful! With a favorable wind we left the port
of Guador and again steered for Yemen. We had been at sea
for several days, and had arrived nearly opposite to Zofar<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
and Shar, when suddenly from the west arose a great storm
known as <i>fil Tofani</i>.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> We were driven back, but were unable
to set the sails, not even the <i>trinquetla</i> (stormsail). The
tempest raged with increasing fury. As compared to these
awful tempests the foul weather in the western seas is mere
child's play, and their towering billows are as drops of water
compared to those of the Indian sea. Night and day were
both alike, and because of the frailty of our craft all ballast
had to be thrown overboard. In this frightful predicament
our only consolation was our unwavering trust in the power
of the Almighty. For ten days the storm raged continuously
and the rain came down in torrents. We never once saw the
blue sky.</p>

<p>I did all I could to encourage and cheer my companions,
and advised them above all things to be brave, and never to
doubt but that all would end well. A welcome diversion occurred
in the appearance of a fish about the size of two galley
lengths, or more perhaps, which the pilot declared to be a
good omen.</p>

<p>The tide being very strong here and the ebb slow, we had
an opportunity of seeing many sea-monsters in the neighborhood
of the bay of Djugd, sea-horses, large sea-serpents, turtles
in great quantities, and eels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>The color of the water suddenly changed to pure white,
and at sight of it the pilot broke forth into loud lamentations;
he declared we were approaching whirlpools and eddies.
These are no myth here; it is generally believed that they
are only found on the coasts of Abyssinia and in the neighborhood
of Sind in the bay of Djugd, and hardly ever a ship
has been known to escape their fury. So, at least, we are told
in nautical books. We took frequent soundings, and when
we struck a depth of five Kuladj (arm-lengths) the mizzensails
(<i>Orta Yelken</i>) were set, the bowspreat<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> ... and ... heeling
over to the left side, and flying the commander's flag,
we drifted about all night and all day until at last, in God's
mercy, the water rose, the storm somewhat abated, and the
ship veered right round.</p>

<p>The next morning we slackened speed and drew in the
sails. A stalwart cabin boy (or sailor) was tied to the
<i>Djondu</i>, whereby the post at the foot of the mizzenmast was
weighted down, and the sailrope slightly raised. Taking a
survey of our surroundings we caught sight of an idol-temple
on the coast of Djamber. The sails were drawn in a little
more; we passed Formyan and Menglir,<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and directing our
course toward Somenat,<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> we passed by that place also.
Finally we came to Div,<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> but for fear of the unbelievers which
dwell there we further drew in our sails and continued on our
course with <i>serderma</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wind had risen again, and as the men had
no control over the rudder, large handles had to be affixed
with long double ropes fastened to them. Each rope was
taken hold of by four men, and so with great exertion they
managed to control the rudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>No one could keep on his feet on deck, so of course it was
impossible to walk across. The noise of the ... and the
... was deafening; we could not hear our own voices. The
only means of communication with the sailors was by inarticulate
words, and neither captain nor boatswain could for a
single instant leave his post. The ammunition was secured
in the storeroom, and after cutting the ... from the ...
we continued our way.</p>

<p>It was truly a terrible day, but at last we reached Gujarat
in India, which part of it, however, we knew not, when the
pilot suddenly exclaimed: "On your guard! a whirlpool in
front!" Quickly the anchors were lowered, but the ship was
dragged down with great force and nearly submerged. The
rowers had left their seats, the panic-stricken crew threw off
their clothes, and, clinging some to casks and some to jacks,
had taken leave of one another. I also stripped entirely,
gave my slaves their liberty, and vowed to give 100 florins to
the poor of Mecca.</p>

<p>Presently one of the anchors broke from its crook and another
at the <i>podjuz</i>; two more were lost, the ship gave a terrible
jerk—and in another instant we were clear of the breakers.
The pilot declared that had we been wrecked off Fisht-Kidsur,
a place between Diu and Daman;<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> nothing could
have saved us. Once more the sails were set, and we decided
to make for the infidel coast; but after duly taking note of
tide and current, and having made a careful study of the
chart, I came to the conclusion that we could not be very far
off the mainland. I consulted the horoscope in the Koran,
and this also counseled patience. So we commenced to examine
the hold of the ship and found that the storeroom was
submerged, in some places up to the walls, in some places
higher still. We had shipped much water, and all hands
set to work at once to bale it out. In one or two places the
bottom had to be ripped up to find the outlet so as to reduce
the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>Toward afternoon the weather had cleared a little, and
we found ourselves about two miles off the port of Daman, in
Gujarat in India. The other ships had already arrived, but
some of the galleys were waterlogged not far from the shore,
and they had thrown overboard oars, boats, and casks, all of
which wreckage eventually was borne ashore by the rapidly
rising tide. We were obliged to lie to for another five days
and five nights, exposed to a strong spring-tide, accompanied
by floods of rain; for we were now in the Badzad,<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> or rainy
season of India, and there was nothing for it but to submit
to our fate. During all this time we never once saw the sun
by day, nor the stars by night; we could neither use our clock
nor our compass, and all on board anticipated the worst. It
seems a miracle that of the three ships lying there, thrown on
their sides, the whole crew eventually got safely to land.</p>


<h5>VI<br />

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PROVINCE OF GUJARAT</h5>

<p>After five days, in God's mercy, the wind somewhat abated.
All that was saved of the wreckage, cannon and other armament
we left with the Governor of Daman, Malik Esed, who,
since the time of Sultan Ahmed, the ruler of Gujarat, had
held office there. In the harbor were some <i>Djonk's</i><a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> <i>i.e.</i>,
monsoon ships belonging to Samiri, the ruler of Calcutta.
The captains came on board our ship and assured us of the
devotion of their chief to the Padishah. They brought us a
letter which said that Samiri was waging war day and night
against the Portuguese infidels, and that he was expecting the
arrival of an Imperial fleet from Egypt under the guidance
of the pilot Ali, which was to put the Portuguese to flight.
Malik Esed, the Governor, gave me to understand that the
fleet of the infidels was on its way, that it behooved us to
avoid it and, if possible, to reach the fortress of Surat. This
news frightened the crew. Some of them immediately took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
service under Melik Esed, and some went ashore in the boats
and proceeded by land to Surat.</p>

<p>I remained on board with a few faithful of the men, and
after procuring a <i>Dindjuy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> or pilot-boat, for each vessel, we
set out for the harbor of Surat. After great difficulties we
reached the open. Presently the Kutwal,<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Aga Hamsa,
hailed us with a letter from Umad-el-mulk, the Grand Vizier
of Sultan Ahmed, who informed us that there were large
numbers of infidels about, and that Daman being a free port
we had better be careful. He would allow us to come to
Surat if we liked, as we were now in most perilous waters.
This was exactly what we wanted to do, so we struggled on
for five days longer, sailing at the flow, riding at anchor at
the ebb of the tide, until at last we reached the harbor of
Surat, fully three months after our departure from Basrah.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of the Mohammedans at Surat when
they saw us come; they hailed us as their deliverers (<i>Khidr</i>),
and said: "You have come to Gujarat in troublous times;
never since the days of Noah has there been a flood like unto
this last, but neither is it within the memory of man that
a ship from Rum (Turkey) has landed on these coasts. We
fervently hoped that God in his mercy would soon send an
Ottoman fleet to Gujarat, to save this land for the Ottoman
Empire and to deliver us from the Indian unbelievers."</p>

<p>The cause of the disturbances was this: After the death
of Sultan Bahadur, the ruler of Gujarat, one of his relatives,
a youth of twelve years old, had succeeded to the throne. The
army had acknowledged him, but one of the nobles, Nasir-ul-Mulk,
had refused to take the oath of allegiance, and had
raised the banner of sovereignty on his own behalf.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
many adherents, took the stronghold of Burudj,<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> left a sufficient
garrison to keep it, proceeded himself to another town,
and then called in the aid of the Governor of the infidels
(Portuguese) at Goa, promising that in return for his services
the harbors on the coast of Gujarat, <i>viz.</i>, Daman, Surat,
Burudj, Ketbaye, Sumenat, Minglur, and Furmeyan, should
be thrown open to the Portuguese, while he would retire to
the land of the interior.</p>

<p>Sultan Ahmed had immediately collected an army to go to
Burudj, and when informed of our arrival he took from our
troops 200 gunners and other men, and advanced toward
Burudj.</p>

<p>On the third day we who were left behind were attacked
by the infidel captains of Goa, Diu, Shiyul, Besai,
and the <i>Provador</i>;<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> five in all, commanding 7 large galleons
and 80 <i>gurabs</i>. We went ashore, pitched our tents, and threw
up entrenchments; for two whole months we were busy preparing
for battle. But the tyrant Nasir-ul-Mulk, who had
joined with the infidels, had hired murderers to kill me; they
were, however, discovered by the guard and fled. Again another
time he tried to poison my food, but, being warned by
the Kutwal of Surat, this attempt to take my life also failed.
Meanwhile Sultan Ahmed had taken the stronghold of Burudj
and sent two of his officers, Khudavend and Djihanghir,
with elephants and troops to Surat, while he proceeded to
Ahmedabad, where a youth, called Ahmed, a relation of Sultan
Ahmed, had in the meantime raised a revolt. A battle
followed, in which the usurper was wounded, Hasan Khan,
one of his adherents, killed, and his army put to flight. Sultan
Ahmed reascended his throne, and, as Nasir-ul-Mulk died
of vexation over his misfortunes, peace was once more restored
in Gujarat.</p>

<p>When the infidels heard of this they sent an envoy to Khudavend
Khan to say that they did not mind so much about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
Surat, but that their hostility was chiefly directed toward the
Admiral of Egypt, <i>viz.</i>, my humble person. They demanded
that I should be given up to them, but were refused; and
my soldiers would have killed the envoy, but I reminded them
that we were on foreign soil and must commit no rash
deeds.</p>

<p>It so happened that a runaway infidel gunner from one of
my ships had enlisted on the ship of the envoy, and, knowing
a good deal about our affairs, he had undertaken to prevent
our departure after the holiday of Kurban. No sooner had
this come to the knowledge of my men, than they attacked
the envoy's ship and captured the infidel, who was executed
on the spot, greatly to the alarm of the envoy.</p>

<p>There is in Gujarat a tree of the palm tribe, called <i>tari
agadji</i> (millet-tree). From its branches cups are suspended,
and when the cut end of a branch is placed into one of these
vessels a sweet liquid, something of the nature of arrack,
flows out in a continuous stream; and this fluid, by exposure
to the heat of the sun, presently changes into a most wonderful
wine. Therefore at the foot of all such trees drinking-booths
have been placed, which are a great attraction to the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Some of my men, having indulged in the forbidden
drink, determined to kill their Serdar. One of these profligates,
Yagmur by name, one evening after sunset surprised
Hussain Aga, the Serdar of the Circassians. A few comrades
rushed to his assistance, there was some fighting and
two young men were wounded, and one, Hadji Memi, was
killed. Then the soldiers pressed round, and implored me to
punish the evil-doers, but I again reminded them that we
were on foreign soil, in the land of a foreign Padishah, and
that our laws had no force here. "What," they cried, "the
laws of our Padishah hold good everywhere. You are our
Admiral, judge according to our law, and we will be the executioners!"
Thereupon I pronounced judgment according
to the law of the Koran, which says: "Eye for eye, life for
life, nose for nose, ear for ear," etc.</p>

<p>The man was executed, and peace restored. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
nobles of the Begs heard of the occurrence they took the lesson
to heart, and the envoy immediately hired a conveyance and
went to Sultan Ahmed.</p>

<p>But my troops were getting dissatisfied. In Surat, Khudavend
Khan had been paying them from 50 to 60 paras per
day, and in Burudj, Adil Khan had done the same. At last
their pent-up feelings burst forth and they argued as follows:
"It is now nearly two years since we have received any pay,
our goods are lost, and the ships dismantled; the hulks are old,
and our return to Egypt is practically made impossible."
The end was that the greater part of them took service in
Gujarat.</p>

<p>The deserted ships, with all their tools and implements,
were given over to Khudavend Khan, under condition that he
should immediately remit to the Sublime Porte the price
agreed upon for the sale.</p>

<p>After receiving a confirmatory note to this effect, both
from Khudavend Khan and Adil Khan, I started on my journey
to Ahmedabad<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> in the beginning of Muharram of the
year 962 (end of November 1552), accompanied by Mustafa
Aga, the Ketkhuda (chief officer) of the Egyptian Janissaries,
and Ali Aga, the captain of the gunners (both of which had
remained faithful to their Padishah), and with about 50
men.</p>

<p>A few days took us from Burudj to Belodra,<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and from
there we proceeded to Champanir.<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>On our way we saw some very curious trees, whose crowns
reached up to the sky, and the branches swarmed with bats
of such extraordinary size that their wings on the stretch measured
40 inches across. The most curious part about the
trees, however, was that the roots hung down from the
branches and, when touching the ground, planted themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
and produced new trees. Thus from one tree, from ten to
twenty new ones sprung up. The name of this tree is the
Tobi tree,<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> and more than a thousand people can find shelter
under its shade. Besides these we saw several <i>Zokum</i> trees.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
Parrots were very plentiful, and as for the monkeys, thousands
of them made their appearance in our camp every evening.
They carried their young in their arms, made the most
ridiculous grimaces, and strongly brought to our minds the
stories of Djihan Shah, according to whom these animals live
in a community but acknowledge no head among them. At
nightfall they always retired to their own place.</p>

<p>After a great many vicissitudes we at last arrived in Mahmudabad,<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
and after a journey of 50 days in Ahmedabad
the capital of Gujarat. There I visited the Sultan, his
Grand Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk, and other dignitaries. The
Sultan, to whom I presented my credentials, was pleased to
receive me most graciously and he assured me of his devotion
to our glorious Padishah. He gave me a horse, a team of
camels,<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> and money for the journey.</p>

<p>At Cherkes, in the vicinity of Ahmedabad, is the grave of
Sheik Ahmed Magrebi, which I visited. One day, being at
the house of Imad-ul-Mulk, I met the infidel envoy, and our
host addressed him in this way, "We have need of the Sultan
of Turkey. Our ships touch the ports of his Empire, and
if we were not free to do so, it would be bad for us. Moreover,
he is the Padishah of the Islamitic world, and it is not
seemly that we should be expected to deliver up his Admiral
to you." I became very angry at this speech and cried:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
"Hold, thou cursed tongue! Thou foundest me with a shattered
fleet, but I swear by God Almighty thou shalt see ere
long not only Ormuz, but Goa itself, yield before the victorious
arms of the great Padishah!"<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> To which the unbeliever
made the following answer: "Henceforth not so much
as a bird will be able to leave the ports of India." I replied:
"One need not necessarily go by water, there is a land route
also." He was silent after that, and the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p>A few days after this Sultan Ahmed offered me the command
of the Province of Burudj, with a very large income,
but I refused, saying that I would not stay if he gave me the
whole of the land. One night in my dream I saw the Khalifa
Murteza Ali. I had a piece of paper before me with Ali's
seal upon it. With this seal, the seal of God to help me, away
with all fear, for in its strength all foreign waters were mine
to command.</p>

<p>Next morning I told my dream to my companions and all
were glad with me. I asked for permission to depart, and
the ruler granted my request out of respect for our Padishah.</p>

<p>Amongst the learned<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> of this land of Banians<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> there is
a tribe which they call the "Bats," whose business it is to
escort merchants or travelers from one land into another,
and for a very small remuneration they guarantee their perfect
safety. Should the Rajputs,<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> <i>i.e.</i>, the mounted troops
of the land, attack the caravan, the Bats point their daggers
at their own breast, and threaten to kill themselves if they
should presume to do the slightest harm to the travelers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>entrusted to their care. And out of respect for the Bats, the
Rajputs generally desist from their evil purpose, and the
travelers proceed on their way unmolested. Occasionally,
however, the Bats carry out their threat, otherwise it would
have no force. But if such a thing does happen, if a caravan
is attacked and the suicide of the Bats becomes necessary, this
is considered a terrible calamity, and the superstition of the
people demands that the offenders be put to death, and not
only the offenders themselves but the chief of the Rajputs
deems it necessary to kill their sons and daughters also; in
fact, to exterminate the whole of their race. The Mohammedans
of Ahmedabad had given us two such Bats as an escort,
and so, about the middle of Safar of the said year, we
started on our overland journey to Turkey.</p>

<p>In five days we reached Patna,<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> traveling in carriages,
and visited the grave of Sheik Nizam the <i>Pir</i> (spiritual
chief) of Patna. Here Shir Khan and his brother Musa
Khan had collected an army, to fight Behluj Khan, the ruler
of Radanpoor.<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> For fear of our siding with their enemies,
the people tried to retain us, and would not allow us to proceed
on our journey until the battle should be over. We
showed them, however, that we had not come to render either
party any assistance, but that we only wanted to continue
our journey in peace, and had a pass from their ruler to that
effect. Then at last they let us go, and after five days we
came to Radanpoor, where I was presented to Mahmud Khan,
but he treated me very rudely, and insisted on forcibly detaining
three of my companions before he would consent to
our departure.</p>

<p>On the way we met some friendly Rajputs; their Beg
was of great service to us, and gave me a letter of protection
(free pass). The camels were hired, and after dismissing
the Bats which the people of Ahmedabad had sent with us, we
continued our journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>


<h5>VII<br />

WHAT BEFELL US IN THE PROVINCE OF SIND</h5>


<p>Leaving on the first of Rebiul-Evvel we came, after a ten
days' journey, to Parker,<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> a town of the Rajputs. Here we
were surprised by the infidels, but thanks to the letter of protection
and a few presents, we were let free; quite anticipating
further dangers, however, we were on our guard when next
day a band of hostile Rajputs commenced a free fight with us.
Immediately I ordered all the camels to be let down on their
knees so as to form a ring round us, and then the firing began
on all sides. The infidels, not prepared for this, sent
us word that "they had not come to fight, but to exact the
passage money," to which I made reply: "We are not merchants
and carry nothing but medicines and <i>Mohurs</i><a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> on
which we have already paid duty; but if there be anything
further to pay we are quite prepared to do so." This had
the desired effect; they let us pass, and for about ten days we
wandered through deserts and sandy places, until we reached
Wanga,<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> the frontier town of Sind. Here we hired fresh
camels, and in five days we came to Djoona<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> and Baghi-Feth.
The throne of Sind was then occupied by Shah Husein
Mirza. He had reigned for 40 years, but during the last
5 years he had become invalided and unable to mount his
horse, so now he only went about on board his ship in the
river Sihun.<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>At that time Isa Terkhan, the commander of the capital of
Sind, called Tata,<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> had put to death a number of able officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
belonging to Shah Husein, after which he had captured the
treasure, stored in the fortress of Nasrabad, and divided it
amongst his men, and then proclaimed himself as Humayun
Shah. (It says literally that he had this title inserted in the
Friday-prayers and ordered the <i>Nakara</i><a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> to be played.)
Thereupon Shah Husein had nominated his adopted brother
Sultan Mahmud as commander of the land troops, and he
himself with 400 ships had set out against the rebels. Hearing
of my arrival he received me with great honor. It was
then the beginning of the month of Rabia-al-Sani. He gave
me festive apparel<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> and conferred upon us the title of a
God-sent army;<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> he offered me, besides all this, the governorship
of Bender-Lahuri or Duyuli-Sindi. Of course I refused
this offer, but when I requested permission to continue my
journey I was given to understand that I should not be allowed
to do so until after the successful termination of the
campaign. He also wrote a letter to our glorious Padishah,
explaining matters; in a word he did not rest until he had
quite cleared us from being mixed up in this war with Isa
Khan. The Mohammedans pleaded in vain that our arms
could bring no evil upon them,<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> for, said they, "Are we not
all of one nation, and are not many of our sons and brethren
in the rebel army?" And this was perfectly true. I had an
interview with Sheik Abdul Vahab and received his blessing;
I also visited the graves of the Sheiks Djemali and Miri.</p>

<p>The campaign lasted a month, earthworks were thrown up
and cannon raised thereon, but as Tata lies on an island and
their shot did not reach so far, the fortress could not be taken.
Nevertheless there was great loss of life on both sides. At
last a compromise was decided upon. Mir Isa relinquished
his adherence to Humayun Padishah, returned to his allegiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
to Husein Mirza, and sent his son Mir Salih with presents
of submission. On the other hand, Husein Mirza gave
the remainder of the treasure, which Mir Isa had divided
amongst his troops, to Mir Salih. Isa was reinstated in his
former rank, and Mirza sent him a formal acceptance of his
allegiance by the hand of the Vizier Molla Yari. He also
sent him a Nakara by Tugbeghi, the chief standard-bearer,
and released from prison the ten rebels from the tribes of
Argun and Tarkhan,<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> which had sided with Mir Isa, from
his side, had sent back the wife of Husein Shah, called Hadji
Begum, and in the first days of Djemadi-ul-evvel, Sultan Mahmud
returned by land, and Shah Husein by water, to the
city of Bakar. On the tenth day after his wife had rejoined
him, Shah Husein died, and it was supposed that she had poisoned
him.</p>

<p>Directly after his father's death, Sultan Mahmud divided
the property in three parts. One part was for the wife of the
deceased, and another part he sent to Mir Isa by a Khodja.
The body was taken to Tata; he lent me one of his own ships,
and providing himself with horses, camels, and other necessaries,
returned by land to Bakar. While the body of Mirza,
with his wife and an escort of 50 ships, was on its way to
Tata, the soldiers attacked the remaining vessels and plundered
them. The sailors took flight, and we, the passengers,
were compelled to take command of the ships. Beset on all
sides by the Djagatais (Central Asians), we relinquished our
firearms, and barely escaped with our lives. At last, after
struggling for ten days against the stream, we made our way
to Nasirpur.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> This town had been plundered by the Rajah,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Bey of the Rajputs.</p>

<p>We were greeted with the news that Mir Isa, with 10,000
valiant soldiers, was pursuing Sultan Mahmud, and that his
son, Mir Salih, with 80 ships, was close behind us. This was
very perplexing but I decided at once to turn back. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
prayed long together, and then started on our return to Tata.
Three days later we passed Mir Salih in the river. I went
on board his ship with a few small presents, and he asked
me where we were going. I said, "We are going to your
father," whereupon he told me to go back with him. I said,
"We have no sailors on board," so he gave me fifteen of his
crew; and thus compelled to turn back, we had another weary
ten days to get through. One day I chanced upon Mir Isa in
a small town of Sind. Here I also found the former partizans
of the late Mirza, who were tired of fighting and desired
peace. Isa received me with great honor, forgave me the
past, and allowed me to remain a few days, saying that he
intended shortly to send his son Mir Salih to Humayun Padishah,
and that I might as well travel under his escort, for,
he added, "Sultan Mahmud will never allow thee to pass
Bakar; he is a son of Ferrukh Mirza and wants to become
Padishah." This proposal, however, did not suit me, and
I insisted upon continuing my journey forthwith, suggesting
that he should give us back the ships lately taken from us, and
also to send a messenger in advance, for with God's help he,
Sultan Mahmud, would probably have to submit to the Padishah
(Humayun), and thus peace be restored. Isa agreed
to this, and gave me seven ships with their complement of
sailors. He wrote to the Padishah to assure him of his unalterable
loyalty, and so we went on our way. We were
struck with the enormous size of the fish (alligators) sporting
in the river, as also with the numbers of tigers on the banks.
It was necessary to keep up a perpetual warfare with the
people of Semtche and Matchi, through whose territory our
course lay, and thus we reached Siyawan,<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> and shortly after
we came to Bukkur by the way of Patri<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and Dible. Here
I fell in with Sultan Mahmud and his Vizier Molla Yari. I
offered a small gift to the former, who thereupon expressed
his willingness to submit himself to Humayun, and also to
make peace with Mir Isa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

<p>I composed a chronogram on the death of Husein Mirza
and presented Sultan Mahmud with two gazels,<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> after
which I requested permission to continue my journey. This
was granted, but as the route past Kandahar was made unsafe
by the inroads<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> of Sultan Bahadur, a son of Sultan Haidar,
the Ozbeg, and as the season of the Semum (hot winds) had
now commenced, the Sultan offered to give me an escort by
the way of Lahore, warning me to be on my guard against the
Djats, a hostile tribe which had its abode there. But whichever
route I chose I should have to wait a while yet, and as
a matter of fact I waited for a whole month. One night in
my dream I saw my mother, who told me that she had seen
her highness Fatima in a dream, and had learned from her the
glad news, that I should soon be coming home, safe and sound.</p>

<p>When next morning I told this dream to my companions
they were full of good courage. Sultan Mahmud, when he
heard of it, at once consented to my departure. He gave me
a beautiful horse, a team of camels, a large and a small tent,<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
and money for the journey. He also provided me with a
letter of recommendation to Humayun, and an escort of 250
mounted camel-drivers, from Sind. Thus we departed about
the middle of Shaaban, and reached the fortress of May in five
days, traveling by the way of Sultanpoor.<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> As the Djats
were very troublesome, we did not take the route of Djenghelistan
(the forest), but preferred to go through the steppe.
On the second day we came to the spring, but found no water,
and many of my companions nearly succumbed with heat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
thirst. I gave them some <i>Teriak</i> (opium), of the very best
quality, and on the second day they were recovered. After
this experience we deemed it advisable to leave the desert and
to return to Mav, for the proverb says truly, "A stranger is
an ignorant man." In the steppe we saw ants as large as
sparrows.</p>

<p>Our escort from Sind was afraid of the wood, and I had to
inspire my own people with fresh courage. I placed 10
gunners in front, 10 in the center, and 10 in the rear of our
caravan, and thus, trusting in God's protection, we commenced
the journey. The people from Sind also took courage after
this, and went with us.</p>

<p>Thus, after manifold dangers, we came after ten days to
Utchi,<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> or Autchi, where I visited Sheik Ibrahim and received
his blessing. I also made a pilgrimage to the graves
of the Sheiks Djemali and Djelali. In the beginning of
Ramazan we resumed our journey and came to the river
Kara, or Kere,<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> which we crossed by means of a raft. The
people of Sind gave us permission to proceed as far as the
Machvara,<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and this river was crossed by boats. On the
other side we found 500 Djats awaiting us, but our firearms
frightened them and they did not attack. We advanced unmolested,
and reached the town of Multan on the fifteenth of
Ramazan.</p>


<h5>VIII<br />

MY EXPERIENCES IN HINDUSTAN</h5>

<p>In Multan I only visited the graves of the Sheiks Baha Bahaeddin,
Zekeria, Rukneddin, and Sadreddin. I received a
blessing from Sheik Mohammed Radjva, and, after receiving
permission to continue my journey from Sultan Mirmiram
Mirza Hasan, we proceeded toward Lahore. In Sadkere I
visited Sheik Hamid, received his blessing, and in the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
days of the Month Shawwal we came to Lahore. The political
state of the country was as follows: After the death
of Selim Shah a son of Shir Khan, the former Sovereign of
Hindustan, Iskender Khan, had come to the throne. When
the Padishah Humayun heard this he immediately left Kabul
and marched his army to India, took Lahore, and fought Iskender
Khan near Sahrand. He won the battle and took
400 elephants, besides several cannon and 400 chariots.
Iskender Khan escaped to the fortress of Mankut, and Humayun
sent Shah Abul-Maali with a detachment of soldiers
after him. Humayun himself proceeded to his residence at
Delhi and dispatched his officers to different places. The
Ozbeg, Iskender Khan, he sent to Agra, and others to Firuzshah
Senbel,<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Bayana, and Karwitch. War raged on all
sides, and when I arrived at Lahore the Governor, Mirza
Shah, would not let me continue my journey until I had seen
the Padishah (Humayun). After sending the latter word of
my arrival, he received orders to send me forthwith to Delhi.
Meanwhile a whole month had been wasted, but finally we
were sent off with an escort. The river Sultanpoor was
crossed in boats and after a journey of 20 days we arrived,
toward the end of Dulkaada, by the route of Firuzshah<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> in
the capital of India, called Delhi. As soon as Humayun
heard of our arrival he sent the Khanikhanan<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> and other superior
officers with 400 elephants and some thousand men to
meet us, and, out of respect and regard for our glorious Padishah,
we were accorded a brilliant reception. That same
day the Khanikhanan prepared a great banquet in our honor;
and as it is the custom in India to give audience in the evening,
I was that night introduced with much pomp and ceremony
into the Imperial hall. After my presentation I offered
the Emperor a small gift, and a chronogram upon the
conquest of India, also two gazels, all of which pleased the
Padishah greatly. Forthwith I begged for permission to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
continue my journey, but this was not granted. Instead of
that I was offered a <i>Kulur</i><a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> and the governorship over the
district of Kharcha. I refused, and again begged to be allowed
to go, but for only answer I was told that I must at
least remain for one year, to which I replied: "By special
command of my glorious Padishah I went by sea to fight the
miserable unbelievers. Caught in a terrible hurricane, I
was wrecked off the coast of India; but it is now my plain
duty to return to render an account to my Padishah, and it is
to be hoped that Gujarat will soon be delivered out of the
hands of the Unbelievers." Upon this Humayun suggested
the sending of an envoy to Constantinople, to save my going,
but this I could not agree to, for it would give the impression
that I had purposely arranged it so. I persisted in my entreaties,
and he finally consented, adding, however: "We
are now close upon the three months of continuous <i>Birshegal</i>,<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
(<i>i.e.</i>, the rainy season). The roads are flooded<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> and impassable,
remain therefore till the weather improves. Meanwhile
calculate solar and lunar eclipses, their degree of latitude,
and their exact date in the calendar. Assist our astrologers
in studying the course of the sun, and instruct us concerning
the points of the equator. When all this is done, and the
weather should improve before the three months are over,
then thou shalt go hence."</p>

<p>All this was said solemnly and decisively. I had no alternative,
but must submit to my fate. I took no rest, however,
but labored on night and day. At last I had accomplished
the astronomical observations, and about the same time
Agra fell into the hands of the Padishah. I immediately
wrote a chronogram for the occasion, which found much favor.
One day, during an audience, the conversation turned upon
Sultan Mahmud of Bukkur, and I suggested that some official
contract (<i>Ahdnameh</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "agreement") should be
made with him, to which Humayun agreed. The document<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
was drawn up, and the Emperor dipping his fist in saffron
pressed it upon the paper, this being the <i>Tughra</i>,<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> or Imperial
signature. Thereupon the document was sent to Sultan
Mahmud.</p>

<p>The Sultan was much pleased, and both he and his Vizier
Molla Yari expressed their thanks for my intervention in a
private letter, which I showed to his Majesty, who had entrusted
me with the transaction.</p>

<p>This incident furnished the material for a gazel, with
which the Sovereign was so delighted that he called me a second
Mir Ali Shir.<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> I modestly declined the epithet, saying
that it would be presumption on my part to accept such praise,
that, on the contrary, I should consider myself fully rewarded
to be allowed to gather up the gleanings after him. Whereupon
the Sovereign remarked: "If for one more year thou
perfectest thyself in this kind of poetry thou wilt altogether
supplant Mir Ali Shir in the affections of the people of the
Djagatais." In a word, Humayun loaded me with marks of
his favor. One day I was talking to Khoshhal, the Imperial
archer, and the Sovereign's special confidant; a superb youth.
He used to take part in the poetical discussions, and provided
me with material for two gazels, which soon became popular
all over India and were in everybody's mouth. The same
good fortune attended my acquaintance with the Afetabedji,<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>
Abdurrahman Bey, a courtier who also rejoiced in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
confidence and affection of the monarch, and was his constant
companion in private life. He also entered the poetical contest,
and I composed two gazels upon him.</p>

<p>In a word, poetical discussions were the order of the day,
and I was constantly in the presence of the Emperor. One
day he asked me whether Turkey was larger than India, and I
said: "If by Turkey your Majesty means Rum proper, <i>i.e.</i>,
the province of Siwas,<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> then India is decidedly the larger,
but if by Turkey you mean all the lands subject to the ruler
of Rum, India is not by a tenth part as large." "I mean
the entire Empire," replied Humayun. "Then," I said, "it
appears to me, your Majesty, that the seven regions over
which Iskender (<i>i.e.</i>, Alexander the Great) had dominion,
were identical with the present Empire of the Padishah of
Turkey. History records the life and the reign of Iskender,
but it is not reasonable to suppose that he actually visited and
personally ruled these seven regions, for the inhabited world
(the fourth part of the present inhabited world) is 180 degrees
longitude and from the equator about 60 degrees latitude.
Its area, according to astronomical calculations, covers
1,668,670 <i>fersahhes</i>. It is therefore an utter impossibility
for any man to visit and govern all these lands in person.
Perhaps he only owned a portion of each of these
regions (<i>Iklim</i>), in the same way as the Padishah of Turkey
does." "But has the ruler of Turkey possessions in all these
regions?" asked Humayun. "Yes, certainly," I replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
"the first is Yemen, the second Mecca, the third Egypt, the
fourth Aleppo, the fifth Constantinople, the sixth Kaffa, and
the seventh Ofen and Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> In each of these regions the
Padishah of Turkey appoints his Beglerbeg and Kadi, who
rule and govern in his name. Moreover, I was told in Gujarat,
by the merchants Khodja Bashi and Kara Hasan (God
alone knows whether their story is true), that when the Turkish
merchants in China desired to insert the name of their
Sovereign in the Bairam prayers on Bairamday, they brought
the request before the Khakan of China, stating that their
Sovereign was Padishah of Mecca, Medina, and the Kibla
(Direction of the prayer), and therefore entitled to have his
name inserted in the Bairam prayers. The Khakan, although
an unbeliever, had insight enough to see the justice of
their request, which he granted forthwith; he even went so
far as to clothe the Khatib<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> in a robe of honor and to make
him ride on an elephant through the city. Ever since that
time the name of the Padishah of Turkey has been included
in the Bairam prayers, and to whom, I ask, has such honor
ever before been vouchsafed?" The Sovereign (Humayun),
turning to his nobles, said: "Surely the only man worthy to
bear the title of Padishah is the ruler of Turkey, he alone
and no one else in all the world."</p>

<p>Another time we were talking about the Khan of the
Crimea, and I remarked that he also held his office under the
Padishah of Turkey. "But," said Humayun, "if that be
so, how, then, has he the right of the <i>Khutbe</i>?" "It is a
well-known fact," I replied, "that my Padishah alone has the
power to grant the right of <i>Khutbe</i> and of coinage." This
statement seemed to satisfy everybody and we prayed together
for the welfare of my Sovereign.</p>

<p>One day the Emperor planned a little excursion on horseback
to visit the graves of the holy Sheiks of Lahore, and
I accompanied him. We visited the graves of Shah Kutbeddin,
the Pir of Delhi, of Sheik Nizam Weli, Sheik Ferid
Shekr-Ghendj, Mir Khosru Dehlevi, and Mir Husein Dehlevi.
When the conversation turned upon the poetical works of Mir
Khosru I quoted some of his best poems, and under their influence
I conceived a most telling distich. I turned to the
Emperor, saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> "It would be presumption on my part to
measure my powers against those of Mir Khosru,<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> but he has
inspired me, and I would fain recite my couplet before your
Majesty." "Let us hear it," said Humayun, and I recited
the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Truly great is only he who can be content with his daily bread.</div>
  <div class="verse">For happier is he than all the kings of the earth."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"By God," cried the monarch, "this is truly sublime!"</p>

<p>It is not so much my object here to make mention of my
poetic effusions, but rather to show up Humayun's appreciation
of poetry.</p>

<p>On another occasion I called upon Shahin Bey, the keeper
of the Imperial Seal, and asked him to use his influence to
obtain permission for me to depart. In order not to come
empty-handed I brought him two gazels, and begged him urgently
to intercede for me. Shahin Bey promised to do his
best, and one day he actually brought me the glad news that
my petition had been granted, but that I was expected to
offer my request formally in verse. The rainy season was
now at an end; I wrote to the monarch, enclosing two gazels,
which had the desired effect, for I received not only permission
to leave, but also presents and letters of safe conduct.</p>

<p>All was ready for the start. Humayun had given audience
on Friday evening, when, upon leaving his castle of pleasure,
the Muezzin announced the Ezan just as he was descending
the staircase. It was his wont, wherever he heard the summons,
to bow the knee in holy reverence. He did so now, but
unfortunately fell down several steps, and received great injuries
to his head and arm. Truly the proverb rightly says,
"There is no guarding against fate."</p>

<p>Everything was confusion in the palace, but for two days
they kept the matter secret. It was announced to the outer
world that the Sovereign was in good health, and alms were
distributed amongst the poor. On the third day, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>that was on the Monday, he died of his wounds.<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Well may
the Koran say, "We come from God and to him do we return."</p>

<p>His son Djelaleddin Ekber was at the time away on a journey
to visit Shah Ebul Maali, accompanied by the Khanikhanan.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
He was immediately informed of the sad event.
Meanwhile the Khans and Sultans were in the greatest consternation;
they did not know how to act. I tried to encourage
them and told them how at the death of Sultan Selim
the situation was saved by the wisdom of Piri Pasha, who
managed to prevent the news of his death from being noised
abroad. I suggested that, by taking similar measures, they
might keep the Sovereign's death a secret until the Prince
should return. This advice was followed. The divan (council
of State) met as usual, the nobles were summoned, and a
public announcement was made that the Emperor intended to
visit his country-seat, and would go there on horseback. Soon
after, however, it was announced that on account of the unfavorable
weather the trip had to be abandoned. On the next
day a public audience was announced, but as the astrologers
did not prophesy favorably for it, this also had to be given up.
All this, however, somewhat alarmed the army, and on the
Tuesday it was thought advisable to give them a sight of their
monarch. A man called Molla Bi, who bore a striking resemblance
to the late Emperor, only somewhat slighter of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>stature, was arrayed in the imperial robes and placed on a
throne specially erected for the purpose in the large entrance
hall. His face and eyes were veiled. The Chamberlain
Khoshhal Bey stood behind, and the first Secretary in front
of him, while many officers and dignitaries, as well as
the people from the riverside, on seeing their Sovereign, made
joyful obeisance to the sound of festive music. The physicians
were handsomely rewarded, and the recovery of the
monarch was universally credited.</p>

<p>I took leave of all the grandees, and with the news of the
Emperor's recovery I reached Lahore about the middle of the
month Rebiul Evvel. This was on a Thursday. Traveling
by the way of Sani-Pata, Pani-Pata, Kirnat, and Tani Sera,
I came to Samani,<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> where I communicated the news to the
Governor that the Padishah (Humayun) was giving audiences,
and that he was in good health.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> From there I went
by the road of Sahrandi to Matchuvara<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> and Bachuvara,<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
and crossing the Sultanpoor by boat I returned to Lahore by
a forced march. Meanwhile Prince Djelaleddin Ekber had
ascended the throne, and in Lahore and many other places his
name was inserted in the Friday prayers. Mirza Shah, the
Governor of Lahore, however, would not permit me to leave,
for he professed to have received orders from the new Emperor
that no one was to be allowed to go to Kabul and
Kandahar. The only way therefore was to go back to the
Emperor (Ekber), and accordingly I went as far as Kelnor,
where I met Djelaleddin Ekber and the Khanikhanan just
opposite the fortress of Mankit.<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>I was informed through Molla Pir Mehemmed,<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>Khodja of Bairam Khan, that during the interregnum I
should remain where I was, and that in a short time he would
appoint me to some post either in Hind or Sind, whichever I
preferred. I hastened to produce my <i>ferman</i>, given to me by
the late Padishah, presenting him at the same time with a
chronogram on the death of his father. My verses pleased
the Mirza and, after examining the <i>ferman</i> of his father, he
gave me leave to continue my journey, stipulating, however,
that I should travel in company with the four Begs, which he
was about to send with troops to Kabul.</p>

<p>Ebul Maali,<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> who meanwhile had been taken prisoner, was
confined in the castle of Lahore. In return for my chronogram
I received a lakh for traveling expenses, and began to
prepare for my journey with the four Begs.</p>

<p>Amongst the many strange and wonderful things I saw in
India I must make mention of a few. The unbelievers are
called in Gujarat "Banian," and in India "Hindu." They
do not belong to the Ehli-Kitab,<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> and believe in fate (<i>kademi-alem</i>).
When a man dies his body is burned by the riverside.
If the deceased leaves a wife past child-bearing she is
not burned; if, however, she is not past that age she is unconditionally
burned. If a wife of her own free will offers
herself to be burned, the relations celebrate the occasion with
great rejoicings. Should the Mohammedans interfere and
forcibly prevent the self-sacrifice, fate decrees that their king
must die, and no other be raised. For this reason, officers
of the Padishah are always present on such occasions, to prevent
any act of violence.<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>
<p>Another curious custom is the use of tame gazelles in
hunting. A noose is lightly thrown over their antlers, and
then they are driven to mix with the wild gazelles. Like
seeks like, and the latter soon make up to their tame companions,
bringing their heads in close proximity to those of
the others. The noose which is round the antlers of the tame
animal falls over the head of the other and pulls it down.
The more it struggles the more it gets entangled, and can not
possibly escape. This method is in use all over India.</p>

<p>Buffaloes are very plentiful in the steppes. They are
hunted with elephants. Turrets are placed on the elephant's
back, in which several men are hidden. Thus they traverse
the plain, and as soon as the elephant comes up with the
buffalo he attacks him with his teeth and holds him till the
hunters get off his back and capture him. Wild oxen (<i>Gaukutas</i>)<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
are hunted in a similar manner, but they are much
stronger than other animals of their kind, and their tongue is
supposed to have such force that they can kill a man with it.
The Emperor Humayun once told me a story to the effect
that one of these wild oxen, having overtaken a man, flayed
him with his tongue from head to foot. The Emperor
vouched for the truth of this story with an oath. The best
<i>kutas</i> are found in the land of Bahr-itch, perhaps that accounts
for their being called <i>Bahri-Kutas</i> (which means sea-<i>kutas</i>),
although they belong unquestionably to the terrestrial
animals. I might go on enumerating many more interesting
and curious things to be seen in India, but it would keep me
too long.</p>

<p>About the middle of Rebiul Evvel we left for Kabul. We
crossed the River Lahore in ships, and came presently to another
large stream, which had to be crossed. Finding no
ships at hand, we built a raft of barrels and chairs and so
managed to reach the other side. Next we came to Bahara,
where another river had to be crossed, this time in ships.
When I told the Governor (Khodja) of this place what Ekber
had commanded, he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span> "God be merciful! As the
Padishah was dead we have not collected the taxes, the people
still owe them. I will send round, collect the moneys and
hand them over to you."<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Mir Babu's and the other Begs
who were of the company consulted together and decided
that as Shah Abul Maali had escaped from his prison in
Lahore, and might possibly have taken refuge with his brother
Kihmerd Bey in Kabul, it would not be safe for them to delay,
but they suggested that I should wait till the tribute-money
was collected, and follow them as soon as I could.</p>

<p>But I argued that the roads were unsafe and dangerous and
that it would be much better to keep all together. I acted
on the principle that "The contented mind shall be satisfied
and the covetous man shall be humbled." So I relinquished
my claim upon the tribute-money and continued my journey
with the others. After crossing the rivers Khoshab<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and
Nilab<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> in ships, I set foot upon the shore of Bakhtar.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>


<h5>XI<br />

OUR EXPERIENCE IN BAKHTAR-ZEMIN (KABULISTAN)</h5>

<p>In the beginning of the month Djemaziul-Evvel we left the
river Nilab and turned toward Kabul. For fear of the
Afghans under Adam Khan, we made a quick march through
the night, and at daybreak we arrived at the foot of the mountain.
So far the Afghans had not seen us, but by the time
we had reached the top there were thousands of them gathered
together. We seized our guns, and with God's help
managed to get out of their way, and came to the town of
Pershuer, <i>i.e.</i>, Peshawur. Soon after, we crossed the Khaiber
Pass, and reached Djushai. In the mountains we saw
two rhinoceroses (<i>Kerkedans</i>),<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> each the size of a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
elephant; they have a horn on their nose about two inches
long. In Abyssinia these animals are much more plentiful.</p>

<p>Presently we reached Laghman,<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and after a very toilsome
journey through Hezareland,<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> we entered Kabulistan and its
capital Kabul. Here I visited the two sons of Humayun,
Mehemmed Hekim Mirza and Perrukk Fal Mirza; I also saw
Mun'im Khan, and, after presenting the <i>ferman</i> from Humayun,
I was treated with much honor. Kabul itself is a
beautiful city, surrounded by mountains covered with snow,
and pleasure-gardens with running brooks. Pleasure and
merriment prevailed everywhere, feasting and banqueting
were the order of the day. In every corner were gaily
dressed, slender <i>Lulis</i><a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> enticing one with music and song to
join the merry crowd; the populace, in fact, seemed to have
no thought for anything but for pleasure and enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Who would long for houris and the Paradise whose good
fortune has brought him amongst the <i>Lulis</i> of Kabul?"</p>

<p>We, however, had no time for such frivolities, our only aim
and object was to reach home as soon as possible. Mun'im
Khan remarked that the roads were snowed up, that the
Hindu Kush could not possibly be passed, and that it would
be far better for us to wait a few days in Kabul; but I
quickly replied that men could overcome mountains, if they
had the mind to do so. Thereupon the Governor commanded
Mir Nezri, the Chief of the Perashi and Peshai, to accompany
me, and his men were to conduct our horses and goods
safely across the mountain pass. We left accordingly in the
beginning of Djemazi ul Evvel and came to Karabag,<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> and
from there to Tcharikar and Pervane or Mervan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>This was Nezri's native country. He collected his men,
and they took us across to the other side of the mountain.
It was a very difficult passage, but we accomplished it that
day, and spent the night in a village at the foot of the pass.</p>


<h5>XII<br />

THE CONDITION OF BADAKHSHAN AND KHATLAN</h5>

<p>Early in the month of Redjeb we came to the city of Anderab,
and journeyed from there through Badakhshan to Talikan,
where I had an interview with Suleiman Shah<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> and
his son Ibrahim Mirza. On the day of our arrival the Mirza
had met us, and received me in his pleasure-garden; I offered
him some presents and a gazel. The Mirza, who understood
poetry, entered into a poetical competition with me, and
introduced me next day to his father, to whom I also offered
gifts and a gazel. The Sovereign also showed me much
attention and loaded me with signs of his favor. There was
hostility between Pir Mohammed Khan, the ruler of Balkh,
and Borak Khan, the ruler of Transoxania, and the roads
were made unsafe, the more so as Pir Mohammed's younger
brother had raised a revolt in Kunduz, Kavadian, and Termed,
which districts were now in great tumult. They advised
me therefore to travel by the way of Badakhshan and
Khatlan,<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and both Suleiman and his son presented me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
horses and garments of honor, besides giving me a letter of
recommendation to Djihanghir Ali, the ruler of Khatlan,
who had married his younger sister; and so I journeyed to
Kishm, the capital of Badakhshan.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> I saw the Sovereign's
pleasure-garden, and Humayun's garden Duabe, and proceeded
from Kalai Zafar<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> to Rustak, and from there to
Bender Semti.<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> I approached Dalli, in Khatlan, from the
Kashgar (eastern) side, and made a pilgrimage to the grave
of Seid Ali Hamadani, and from there I went to Kulaba,<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
where I met with Djihanghir Ali Khan, and after presenting
my letter of recommendation he gave me an escort of 50 men
to conduct me to Charsui, where I crossed the Pul-i-Senghin<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
(stone bridge), and dismissed the men who had escorted us.</p>


<h5>XIII<br />

EVENTS IN TURAN (<span class="smcap">TRANSOXANIA</span>)</h5>

<p>On the day that I crossed the bridge I first set foot on
Transoxanian soil. After a day's rest I proceeded to Bazar
No (New-Market), and from there to a little place called
Tchiharshembe, where I visited the grave of the Khodja
Yaakub Tcharkhi. Then on to Tchaganian, <i>i.e.</i>, Hissar-i-Shadman.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
I visited Timur Sultan, the Kagalga<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> of the
Ozbeg rulers, and passed Mount Senghirdek,<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> where it always
rains and a considerable stream is formed at the foot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
the mountain, and I marveled at the wonderful works of God.
The next station was Sehri-Sebz, <i>i.e.</i>, Kesh, where I met
Hashim Sultan, who gave me permission to continue my
journey to Samarkand. With great difficulty we got across
the mountain<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> situated between the two last-named places;
we touched the little town of Mazar, and in the beginning
of Shaaban we reached Samarkand, which is a perfect paradise.
Here I saw Borak Khan<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> (more correctly called
Noruz Ahmed), who, in return for my humble offerings, gave
me a horse and garments of honor. It was this same Borak
Khan to whom his Majesty the Padishah had sent cannon and
guns by the hand of Sheiks Abdullatif and Dadash. At
the time of my arrival Abdullatif Khan, the rider of Samarkand,
was dead,<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> and Borak had taken his place. Pir Mohammed
Khan, in Balkh, and Burhan Seid Khan,<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> in Bokhara,
declared their independence, and Borak's first business
was to settle this matter. He began by taking Samarkand
and proceeded to Shehri-Sebz, where a great battle was
fought, in which the Ketkhuda (overseer) of the Osman soldiers
fell. He then took the stronghold and marched to
Bokhara, which place he laid siege to. Seid Burhan, the
ruler of Bokhara, made peace with Borak, relinquished the
place to him, and retired to Karakul, where the brother of
Pir Mohammed Khan then reigned. He, however, gave up
the place to Seid Burhan. When Borak Khan entered Samarkand,
the Aga of the Osmans<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> had just started with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
few men on their way to Turkey, having taken the way of
Tashkend and Turkestan. Ahmed Tchaush was also on the
point of returning to Turkey by the way of Bokhara and
Kharezm, for part of the Janissaries had enlisted under
Seid Burhan, and the remainder joined his son. About 150
remained faithful to Borak Khan. When he had communicated
all this to me, he added: "I am now as a liar before
his Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, for I can do nothing, but if
thou wilt help me, something may yet be done." He offered
me the government of a Province, but I said that with such
a small army nothing could be done, moreover that, without
the consent of my Padishah, I could not stir in the matter.
He thereupon proposed to send an envoy to the Sublime Porte
to explain the situation. As a matter of fact he had already
decided to send Sadr Alem, a descendant of Khodja Ahmed
Jesewi,<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> and gave him a letter, in which he expressed his
willingness in the future to satisfy every wish of the Sultan.
He discharged me, however. During my stay in Samarkand
I made a pilgrimage to the grave of the prophet Daniel, to
the place of the Khidr (Elias), to the cloak and to the
wooden shoes of the Prophet, and also to the Koran, written
by Ali himself.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Besides these places I visited the graves
of the following sheiks and sages: the author of Hidayet,
Ebu Mansur Matridi; Shah-Zinde, Khodja Abdullah, Khodja
Abdi-birun, Khodja Abdi-derum, the Tchopanata, and the
Kazizade of Rum, and the grave of the 444,000 Transoxanian
sages.</p>

<p>But to return to Borak Khan. One day, while talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
together, he asked me which of all the cities I had visited
pleased me most. I replied with the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Far from home no one longs for Paradise.</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">For in his eyes his native town is superior even to Bagdad."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Thou hast spoken well," said the Khan.</p>

<p>Now as regards the embassage to Constantinople, Sadr
Alem proposed to go by Turkestan, but when he was told that
the Nogai tribe of the Mangit committed violence upon travelers,
and that the roads swarmed with robbers and highwaymen,
who gave no quarter to Mussulmans,<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> but plundered
and ill-treated any that came in their way, he decided to
travel through Bokhara.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just then the news came that Seid Burhan
had again declared war with Borak Khan, and that the latter's
son Kharezm Shah had been attacked. Borak Khan advised
me thereupon to remain at Ghidjduvan until the return of
the envoy. If no hostilities took place we might travel by
that way, but otherwise we were to wait until he sent some
one to conduct us safely through Bokhara. To this I agreed.
On the fifth of Ramazan we started, touched Kala and Kermineh,
crossed the river of Samarkand<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> at Duabe, and so
arrived at Ghidjduvan,<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> where I visited the grave of Khodja
Abdul Khalik.</p>

<p>As the Mirza was not here, and no news concerning him
could be obtained, we went on to Pul Rabat. Meanwhile
the troops of Prince Kharezm Shah had prepared for battle.
Suddenly Khan Ali Bey, the Prince's tutor, accosted us with
the question whither we were going. When I replied: "To
Bokhara," he said: "Seid Burhan, the ruler of Bokhara,
threatens to attack Prince Kharezm Shah, and we pray thee
to help us." "How now!" I cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span> "we help no man;
Borak Khan has not requested us to do so; on the
contrary, he has charged us to go to Ghidjduvan, and there to
await the return of the envoy." So we continued on our
way. As we approached Minar (Spire) about 100 redcoats
(<i>Ala tehapan</i>)<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> rushed down upon us, crying: "In the name
of the Mirza, turn back," and at the same time they struck
one of my companions. Immediately we prepared to fight,
when a Seid sprang forward and commanded the Ozbegs to
stop. Both sides held back, and the Seid announced that the
Mirza sent us greeting and desired us not to proceed any
farther, but to look on from a distance. So we were compelled
to turn back. With ten of my companions I had an
interview with the Mirza, who renewed his request that we
should help him; but I refused again, whereupon ten guns
were forcibly taken from us and we were commanded to remain
mere spectators. The Prince's bearing was very
haughty before he had sighted the enemy, for as the proverb
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Our own fist is always of iron,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Until we receive the first box on the ear."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But no sooner had Seid Burhan appeared in sight, from the
opposite direction, than the Prince retreated across the
bridge to the Rabat (Karvanserai). I went on with six
companions, which I left behind me in the court of the kiosk.
Seid Burhan advanced with 1,000 Kizil-Ayaks,<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> <i>i.e.</i>, young
men from Bokhara, and 40 Turkish archers, therefore well
equipped for war. In a moment he defeated the Prince, who,
being wounded by a bullet, took flight, leaving his colors,
musical and other military instruments behind him on the
battle-field. Of my three companions which fled with the
Prince, one was wounded by a lance and died soon after,
and while the others retreated with the Ozbegs into the Rabat
where they were attacked by Seid Burhan, I went on to meet
the army to inquire after the Mirza, leaving my horse in
charge of two men. I heard that he was quartered close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
the Rabat, and asked to be conducted into his presence, and
just as I was crossing the bridge, attended by a few men,
some villain wounded me with an arrow. This was the signal
for a general attack; swords were raised on all sides, and I
was very near losing my life.</p>

<p>Fortunately the attack had been witnessed by the Osmans
serving under the Khan; they had recognized me and came
to my rescue, calling out: "This man is the guest of our
Prince, what then is the meaning of this?" The Ozbeghi
(commander of 10 men) immediately stopped the attack
and apprized the Khan of what had taken place, whereupon
the latter, a glorious youth, hastened to me, embraced
me, and begged my forgiveness, for it was by accident, he
said, that I had become mixed up in the battle and I had
been attacked on the principle of the proverb which says:
"Wet and dry burn together." He commissioned two officers
to conduct us over the bridge, during which transport two
more of my people were attacked and received sword wounds.
I lost on this occasion a beautiful led-horse, all my cooking
apparatus, one pack-horse, and 10 saddle-horses, which were
stolen by the soldiers. With much difficulty I got across the
bridge, and, while I was resting at a little distance, the Khan,
to please me, ordered the Turkish soldiers stationed in the
Rabat to hand the place over to me, as we were innocent and
free from all reproach. As I approached the place I called
out: "Stop fighting; I am here, and the Khan will pardon
you for my sake." Thus the Rabat fell into my hands and
with it some of the lost horses, but many of the firearms
were irrevocably lost. My two men, who had been taken
prisoner in the fight, had escaped, and so we proceeded to the
town, which we reached that night. Seid Burhan spoke
thus to me: "Be thou my guide in this and in the next
world; this land shall henceforth belong to thy Padishah, thou
shalt rule in Bokhara and I will retire to Karakol." "Not
so," was my reply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> "if thou gavedst me the whole land of
Transoxania I could not stay here. Know, O Khan! that I
shall report before the Sublime Porte the injustice which has
been done to thee, and my glorious Padishah will be gracious
unto thee, and possibly the government of these provinces will
be entrusted to thy care." These words pleased the Khan;
he gave a banquet in my honor and showed me much kindness,
and during the fortnight which I spent in Bokhara he
visited me every day in the pleasure-garden which served as
my residence. I composed a gazel in his honor, which highly
delighted him and led to many poetical discussions. When
at last I desired permission to continue my journey, he demanded
of me that I should give him our iron guns in exchange
for his brass ones. He pressed me so hard that I was
compelled to give in, and received 40 brass muskets in return
for all the iron ones which we had left. I also had to exchange
my led-horse for a gelding, besides giving him two
precious books.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the envoy from Borak Khan had arrived, who
apologized to me for his son (Kharezm Shah), and made
peace with Seid Burhan through the mediation of the Ghidjduvani
Abdul Sultan. Thus peace and security were once
more restored.</p>

<p>I delayed in Bokhara to make pilgrimages to the graves
of Bahaeddin Nakishbendi, Kazi Khan, Tchar Bekir, Khodja
Ebn Hifz Kebir, Sadr esh Sheriat, Tadj esh Sheriat, Seid
Mir Kelal (the spiritual head of Baha-eddin), Sultan Ismail
the Samanide, Eyub and Sarakhsi, and after that I journeyed
to Kharezm.</p>

<p>Our way led first to Karakol, then to Farab, where we
crossed the Oxus in ships, and early in the month Shavval
I touched Iranian soil, namely Khorassan. The first town I
stopped at was Tchardjui,<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> where I visited the grave of
Khodja Meshed, a brother of Imam Ali Musa.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Then we
took the road through the wilderness<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> to Kharezm. By
day and by night we had to wage war against lions;<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
not safe for one man to go alone to draw water; but at last,
after ten days of unutterable weariness, we reached Hezaresp,<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
and from there in five days, Khiva, where I visited
the grave of Pehlevan Mahmud Pir.</p>


<h5>XIV<br />

OUR EXPERIENCES IN KHAREZM AND DESHTI-KIPCHAK</h5>

<p>Toward the end of Shavval we left Khiva, and in five days
we came to Kharezm, where I made the acquaintance of
Dost Mohammed Khan and his brother Esh-Sultan.<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> I visited
the graves of Sheik Nedjmeddin Kubera, Sheik Ali
Rametin, Sheik Khalweti Yan, Imam Mohammed Bari'i,
Sahib Kuduri, Djar Ullah Ulama, Molla Husein Kharezmi
(the expounder of the Koran), Seid Ata, and Hekim Ata.</p>

<p>When it was brought to my knowledge that the holy Sheik
Abdullatif had died in the city of Vezir, I could not rest
until I had made a pilgrimage to his grave in company with a
few friends. As this saint had been, moreover, my spiritual
adviser in Sufism, I recited the whole Koran over his grave,
to insure for him everlasting peace and bliss in Paradise.
We also cooked a <i>pilaf</i> (a rice dish) and I prepared a
chronogram in commemoration of his death.</p>

<p>Having received letters of commendation to the Manghit
chiefs, from Hadji Mohammed Sultan, Timur Sultan, and
Mahmud Sultan, the three sons of Agatai Khan, I returned
to Kharezm, where Sheik Sadr Alem, the envoy of Borak
Khan, had meanwhile also arrived. Our party consisted
besides ourselves of the wife of Sheik Husein of Kharezm
(daughter of Makhdum Aazam), the Sheik's son, and a few
Moslems; we traveled in carriages. Most of the company
wore clothes of sheepskin and they wanted us to do the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
for they said, the Manghit<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> are worse even than the Ozbegs,
and when they see strangers they invariably take them
for Russians,<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> which is synonymous to saying, they attack
them. Thus we were compelled to don the outlandish garb
(sheepskin), for, as I said to encourage my people: "A
wise man follows the ways of the world and makes no trouble
of it."</p>

<p>Thus equipped we started in the first days of Zilkaada.
For more than a month we wandered about in the Deshti
Kipchak<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> (Kirghiz steppe). It was late in the autumn, and
at that time of the year not a bird, not a wild ass (<i>Onagre</i>)
can be seen, for there is not a vestige of verdure, not a drop
of water to be found. It was one interminable wilderness;
one desert steppe. At last we came to a place called Sham,
and shortly after to Saraidjik,<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> where we met some Hadjis
and three of the Moslems which had been discharged at Samarkand.
These latter were quite naked, and at sight of us they
cried: "Whither go ye? Astrakhan is taken by the Russians,
Ahmed Tchaush has fought in battle with them, and
our Aga has been plundered by the troops of Arslan Mirza.
The way is blocked, be warned and go back." In vain I
quoted the lines:</p>

  <div class="verse">For ten armed men can not rob one who has nothing."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The rest of the company, especially the merchants, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
not of my opinion; they proposed to delay a few days in
Kharezm and await events, for:</p>

<p>"Speed is from the devil and patience is from God."</p>

<p>The envoy and the other Moslems were of the same mind,
and so I reluctantly retraced my steps to Kharezm. The
envoy returned to Samarkand, but all the rest remained in
Kharezm, and when Dost Mohammed Khan, the ruler of
Khiva, inquired of me by which route I now proposed to
travel, I replied, "I will go by the way of Meshhed in
Khorassan to Irak Adjemi, and from there to Bagdad."
Thereupon the Khan said: "Remain here with us. In the
spring the Manghits seek their pastures, possibly the Russians
may also quit the land by that time, and, remember,
the way to Bagdad is long."</p>

<p>But I could not agree to this, and in support of my argument
I quoted the proverb: "To the lover Bagdad is not far
distant"; so at last the Khan had to give in. He agreed to
my departure, gave me a beautiful horse, and to my companions
he gave the carriage in which we had traveled up to
here.</p>

<p>As regards our route my first plan was to travel by the
way of the Caspian Sea and Shirvan, but my companions
did not like this, because the Mussulman army which had
lately broken up from Kaffa<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> had become involved in a bloody
war with Abdullah Khan, who would not permit any Turks to
pass that way. Next we made inquiries about the roads of
Circassia, past Demir-Kapu, but we heard that the Circassians
had raised a revolt. There remained therefore only
the way of Khorassan and Irak, and concerning these districts
we learned that the Persian King was in perfect harmony
with our glorious Padishah,<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> but that the Bey of Kizilbash
(the Shiite officer) would probably prevent us from obtaining
admittance to the Shah. I thought to myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> "Where God
does not slay, man's attempts are but futile"; moreover,
"they who fear death should not venture on travels"; so
after duly consulting the horoscope,<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> and having made quite
sure that there was no other way open to us, I decided to
travel through Persia. The camels were hired and all was
ready; I went to take leave of Dost Mohammed, the ruler of
Khiva, who remarked casually that it was quite impossible
for us to travel with firearms through the enemy's land.
Thereupon we gave half of our arms to the Khan, and the
other half to his younger brother Esh Sultan. We received
a letter of commendation to Ali Sultan, a brother of Tin Sultan,
and being well stocked with provisions and large skins
for water, and trusting in God, we started on our journey
to Kharezm in the beginning of the month Zilhidje.</p>


<h5>XV<br />

OUR FATE IN KHORASSAN</h5>

<p>By divine grace we got safely across the Oxus<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> and encamped
on the opposite shore, awaiting the arrival of the rest
of our party. While there, the wife of Sheik Husein sent
me a message to say that she had a dream in which she had
seen her father, the holy Makhdum Aazam, who had come
from Vezir to Kharezm in company with another holy sage.
Arrived in the town he had thus addressed the people, who
welcomed him joyfully:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> "Mir Sidi Ali has read the Koran
over my grave in Vezir, and he has supplicated for my
patronage. I have therefore come to help him and to lead him
safely through Khorassan." This message filled me with joy.
I struck camp next morning and the day following we arrived
in Dorum;<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> we passed through, unmolested by Mahmud Sultan,
and proceeded to Bagwai,<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> which place we also passed,
without being hindered by Pulad Sultan, and came to Nesa.<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
Here I found Ali Sultan, former Governor of Merw, and
brother of Tin Sultan, to whom I offered my letter of commendation
from Esh Sultan, and was allowed free passage,
for everybody in these parts is devoted to his Majesty our
Padishah. Thus we came to Bawerd (Abiwerd)<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> and Tus,
where I visited the graves of Imam Mohammed Hanifi and of
the poet Firdusi; and on the first of Muharram of the year
964 I reached Meshhed-i-Khorassan, where I immediately
made a pilgrimage to the grave of Imam Ali Musa Riza, the
prince of Khorassan.</p>

<p>When at sea, during the great storm some time ago, I had
vowed to give a <i>Tumen</i> to the Imam; now I fulfilled my
vow, and paid a <i>Tumen</i> to Mutawali (the overseer of the
Mosque and Mausoleum) and I also paid a <i>Tumen</i> to the
Seid. In Meshhed I found Ibrahim Mirza, the son of Behram
Mirza, who occupied the throne there; also Suleiman
Mirza, the son of Shah, and his Vekil (representative) called
Kokche Khalipha, who entertained me at a banquet.</p>

<p>In the course of our conversation, these gentlemen naturally
wished to draw me into an argument upon the succession
and sanctity of the Caliphs Ali, Ebubekr, Omar, and
Osman; but I acted upon the principle that silence is the
best answer to give a fool, and I was silent. They pressed
me, however, and I told them the story of Khodja Nasreddin,
who was once asked to read the Koran in the Mosque, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
which he had replied, "this is not the place." "And now,"
I said, "I have not come hither to argue with you, and I
refuse to be questioned." It was with great difficulty that
I at last rid myself of them.<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>One of the guests, unfortunately, was a miscreant, of the
name of Ghazi Bey; he gave vent to his wrath in these words:
"It is not seemly to send such people as these to the Shah.
How do we know that they may not kill the men we give
them as an escort, and then take flight? Very possibly they
belong to the Ottomans that were sent to Borak Khan, or
perhaps they are the bearers of a secret correspondence, and it
might be advisable to search them."</p>

<p>The Mirza (Ibrahim) approved of this plan, and the next
morning 200 men in armor (<i>kurdji</i>) surrounded the <i>kervanserai</i>
and took us prisoners. As the proverb says: "Those
who can not be caught by fair means will be by foul play."</p>

<p>We were each of us put in charge of one of the guards;
I was taken to the apartment of the Kokehe Khalipha, with
my two attendants. My horses were given in another
man's charge, and my other effects were entrusted to Mutawali's
keeping. They made us undress, and as it was winter
we suffered much from the cold. The next day the Mirza
took from me all my official papers and sundry letters which
I had received from different princes, and had them all put
into a bag and sealed.</p>

<p>When my companions saw this they trembled for their lives,
but I comforted them with the sayings, "He who falls
through no mistake of his will not shed tears," and "Since
fate has not forgotten to bring thee into this world, it will
not forget to take thee out of it," and further, "Patience is
the key to the final goal."</p>

<p>So we calmly resigned ourselves to our fate. A little later
on all were put in chains, except myself; but I was strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
guarded by five men. This action of the Mirza troubled me
not a little, and although I tried to make light of it, my heart
was very heavy. I wrote a gazel to comfort myself, and
with the inspiring thoughts suggested by it fresh in mind,
I fell asleep, and being in a semiconscious state, a divine inspiration
in the form of a <i>Murabba</i><a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> was vouchsafed to me,
which I sent to Mutawali. This composition caused great
excitement among the nobility of the place. About the same
time one of the attendants of the Imam declared (whether it
was true or feigned I can not say) that in his dream he had
seen the Caliph Ali, who had charged him to go and set Mir
Sidi Ali free. The news of this dream spread rapidly through
the town and stirred up the people, whose sympathies were
now all turned in my favor.</p>

<p>Mutawali and Seid went to the Mirza and said: "This
man came on a pilgrimage to visit the shrine of the Imam.
He is under a vow and desires to go to the Shah. As the Shah
is on friendly terms with the Padishah of Turkey it is not
right that we should in any way trouble this pilgrim now
in the Ashura<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> days. If the man be a traitor, it is sure to
come to light, for as the Koran says, 'A traitor is known by
his countenance,' and there need be no further question of
suspicion." These words of the wise man and of Seid did
not lose their effect upon the Mirza. From my side I pointed
out to him the unreliableness of the information upon which
he had acted, and in order further to enlist his sympathies
in my favor I sent him three poems, after which, partly for
fear of the Shah, and partly regretting his rash deed, he gave
us our liberty on the tenth of Ashura. He loaded me with
presents and gave another banquet in my honor. He also
restored to us our horses and our clothes; but many of my
other possessions I never recovered. Four valuable books
were taken, and the whole of my correspondence was conveyed
by his armour-bearer, Ali Bey, and a Yassaul to the
Shah in a sealed bag, the transport being effected on a barrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
about the middle of Muharram of the said year. Traveling
in the same caravan with us was one of the wives of the Shah
and one of the wives of Behram Mirza, who were both returning
from a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Imam. I
made their acquaintance, and they treated us kindly. By
my advice my companions comported themselves with due
courtesy and modesty toward the retinue of these ladies, mindful
of the saying: "The peace of two worlds depends on two
things only, courtesy to friends and flattery to foes."</p>

<p>Arrived in Mshabur I visited the graves of Imamzade
Mohammed Mahruk, and of Sheik Attar (<i>ferideddin</i>). Here
I also met with Aga Kemal, the Vekil of Khorassan, who,
however, did not interfere with us. In Sebzevar we met with
a little hostility, but acting on the principle that "Barking
dogs bite not," we soon got free from these firebrands and continued
on our way.</p>


<h5>XVI<br />

OUR VICISSITUDES IN IRAK-ADJEM</h5>

<p>Arrived in the Province of Irak we skirted the Demavend
range, traveling from Mazendran to Bestam, where we visited
the graves of Mohammed Aftah, Sheik Bayazid Bestami,
and Sheik Ebulhasan Harkani. The next day we reached
Damgan.</p>

<p>That night one of our company called Ramazan the pious,
and known as <i>Boluk Bashi</i>,<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> had a dream. Bayazid Bestami
with 40 Dervishes had appeared unto him and had spoken
thus: "Let us pray for the safe return of Mir Sidi Ali."
The Sheik, moreover, had written a passport and sealed it,
"that we might not be molested by the way."—This was
his dream, and when I heard of it I rejoiced greatly and
thanked God for his mercy vouchsafed; for this message
(from the dead) virtually saved my life. After visiting the
grave of Imam Djafar in Damgan, we proceeded to Semnan,
where we visited the grave of Sheik Ala-ed-Dowleh Semnani.
In this place they tried to draw us into sectarian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
controversies, but I restrained my comrades, and reminded them
of the Hadis, which says: "<i>Ustur zahbak, zahabek in mazhabak</i>,"
<i>i.e.</i>, "hide thy gold, thine opinions, and thy faith";
and I argued with them, saying, "Not one of you has traveled
more than I have, and experience has made me wise. A
wise man does not heed the words of the vulgar and the ignorant."</p>

<p>They saw the wisdom of my words, and acted upon my
advice.</p>

<p>Before long we came to Rei,<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> where I made pilgrimages to
the graves of Imam Abdul Azim, and of Bibi Shehrbanu, the
consort of Imam Husein. Here I also met Mohammed
Khudabend, a son of the Shah's, and the <i>Kurdji-bashi</i><a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
Sevindek Aga. Their presence was accounted for in this
way: Some time ago the Shah had sent Ismail Mirza from
Kazvin to Herat, and had now recalled him to Kazvin. The
reason of this was that certain things which had happened
during his rule had come to light, and by command of the
Shah one of the nobles of Kazvin had been executed, and in
like manner, also by order of the Shah, some followers of
Ismail had been put to death. After this the Shah commanded
Prince Mohammed Khudabend to appear before him,
and the <i>Kurdji-bashi</i> was sent to fetch him. I was very
pleased to meet the Prince, who assured me of the unwavering
devotion of the Shah to our glorious Padishah.</p>

<p>Journeying from Rei it took us a month and a half (to
the end of Safar) before we reached Kazvin, the capital of
Irak.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Upon the Shah being told of our arrival we were none of
us allowed to enter the city, but had to take up our quarters
in Sebzeghiran, one of the neighboring villages, under the
protection of Mohammed Bey, the <i>Divan Bey</i><a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> of the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
Vizier Maasum Bey. Presently the <i>Ishik Agasi</i><a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> arrived,
who took down our names, and the number of our horses,
and gave his people private instructions to watch us strictly
at night, until further orders.</p>

<p>We were told that the Shah was very angry that we had
been allowed to leave Meshhed without any further inquiry,
and that in consequence of this Kokche Khalipha and Mir
Munshi (first secretary) had been deprived of office. Following
up this information, the Kapchadji, Ali Bey, came to
us by order of Yassaul Pir Ali, and said: "The people here
have evil intentions, if you have any ready money about you,
give it to me to keep, and if Providence deliver you out of
this plight, I will return it; if on the other hand evil should
befall you it is better that your riches should fall in the hands
of friends than of foes."</p>

<p>But I replied: "People who have wandered so long in
foreign parts carry no cash about them, and they who fear
death do not venture so far from home. I believe in the
words of the Koran: 'He who is appointed to die can not
delay the hour, and without God's permission no man can
slay.'"</p>

<p>It so happened that the Shah had by this time examined the
letters which had been conveyed to him in a sealed bag, and
the ladies who had traveled with us bore witness that we
were poor and harmless folk. Moreover, I had sent the Shah
a quatrian which had found much favor, so he set us free.
The Shah commanded his Vekil,<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Maasum Bey, to offer me a
banquet, after which he would himself entertain me. Maasum
Bey was also commissioned to give me the glad news,
that I was free to go where I liked, and, as an envoy was
shortly to be sent to the Sublime Porte, I might, if I liked,
travel by the way of Azerbaidjan, <i>i.e.</i>, by Tebriz and Van.
Thereupon I requested that my desire might be made known
to the Shah. I said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span> "We are not prepared to meet the hardships
of the Van road in the winter time, and we beg to be
allowed to travel by the way of Bagdad"; which request he
graciously granted.</p>

<p>On the second day we were invited by the Shah to a banquet,
and I presented my humble offerings. During the feast we
conversed upon poetical and other subjects, and the Shah remarked
to his courtiers: "These men do not look like intriguers;
they are only pilgrims and religious fanatics"—and
on the strength of this verdict Kokche Khalipha and Mir
Munshi were reinstated in their office. I received a horse
and two changes of robes, a bale of silk, and several other
things; the two Serdars received each two robes of honor,
and my five traveling companions, each one. Altogether the
Shah behaved handsomely to us and showed a marked respect
for the person of his Majesty the Padishah.</p>

<p>One day I was invited to a banquet in the large music-hall,
all the Beys of the royal family being present. To give some
idea of the magnificence here displayed I will only mention
that from five hundred to one thousand <i>Tumens</i><a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> had been
spent on the decoration of the hall. There were some hundreds
of velvet and silken brocaded carpets, painted and embroidered
in figurative designs; quantities of luxurious
cushions and exquisitely artistic tents, canopies, and sunshades.</p>

<p>Yuzbashi Hasan Bey, one of the Shah's confidants, turned
to me and said: "Is not this indeed a treasure-house?" "It
is," I replied, "yet the wealth of kings is not measured by
their gold and silver but by their military power." This
remark silenced him; he did not return to the subject.</p>

<p>As the envoy had already started for Tebriz I was detained
for another month, during which time the Shah showed me
much attention, and I spent a good deal of my time in his
presence. One day he ventured the remark: "Why were
those 300 Janissaries sent from Turkey to assist Borak
Khan?" I answered that these had not been sent to
strengthen Borak Khan's forces, but merely as an escort to
the late Sheik Abdullatif, because it was a well-known fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
that the Circassians<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> had killed Baba Sheik, a son of the
holy Ahmed Jesewi, on the road from Astrakhan, and that
that route was therefore made unsafe. If the Padishah had
intended to send military help, not three hundred, but some
thousands of Janissaries, would have gone to Bokhara.</p>

<p>Another time I was drawn into a religious dispute with
Mir Ibrahim Sefevi, one of the Shah's relatives and a sage.
The conversation ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Ibrahim</span>: "Why do the learned men of Turkey call us
unbelievers?"</p>

<p>I: "It is said that the followers of the Prophet have been
insulted by your countrymen, and according to the
statutes of our religion he who insults his superiors
is an unbeliever."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ibrahim</span>: "That is what Imam Aazam (Ebn Hanifa)
says, but according to Imam Shafi this belongs to the
pardonable offenses."</p>

<p>I: "I understand that it is customary with you to accuse
Ayesha, the wife of the Prophet (may God have
mercy upon her), of immorality, and as this throws a
stigma on the Prophet's name, it is synonymous to
blasphemy. The people who can do this are in a
state of apostasy, and their life is forfeited. Their
goods can be confiscated and their men put in prison.
Any one persisting in this unbelief is subject to imprisonment,
but if they renounce they may, without
their wives, with or without marriage...."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ibrahim</span>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span> "I must contradict this. In our eyes also,
any one who accuses Ayesha of immorality is an unbeliever
and a blasphemer and contradicts the Koran;
because in the Sacred Book God Almighty testifies to
the virtue of Ayesha. But all the same we can not
love her because she set herself against Ali."</p>

<p>I: "How do you explain it that although the Hadis declares
that the Ulemas are on a level with the prophets
of the people of Israel, it nevertheless frequently happens
that offensive language is used against the
former?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ibrahim</span>: "Does the name Ulema not include our Ulemas
also?"</p>

<p>I: "In a facetious way it includes all Ulemas, but beyond
this it is a well-known fact that it is said of them:
'The flesh of the Ulema is poisonous, their odor is
sickening, and to eat them is death'; and if in spite of
this men will insult them, they must pay the penalty
both in this world and in the next."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this he could make no reply, and I turned the conversation
into another channel.</p>

<p>The Shah once said to me, "Tell me, since thou hast
traveled so much, which of the cities thou hast visited pleases
thee best." And I replied: "I have indeed seen most of the
cities of this world, but I have found none to compare with
Stamboul and Galata."</p>

<p>The Shah allowed this to pass, and continued: "At how
many <i>Tumens</i> dost thou estimate the combined income of the
Beys and Beylerbeys of Turkey?" to which I replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span> "The
Beys and Beylerbeys of Turkey receive payment according
to their rank, but they enjoy besides this generally a private
income. Other princes remunerate their officers in proportion
to the pay of the regiment which they command, but if
the pay of the Beys and other officers in the service of the
Emperor of Turkey were to be based upon this foundation,
it would run not into <i>Tumens</i>, nor yet Lakhs,<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> but into
<i>Kulurs</i>. To give you an example: The payments made to
the Beylerbeys of Rumelia, Anatolia, Egypt, Hungary (Budin,
<i>i.e.</i>, Ofen), Diarbekir, Bagdad, Yemen, and Algiers, are,
each in themselves, as much as any other prince would lay
out on the whole of his army. This proportion holds good
for all the other Beylerbeys also, and is in strict accordance
with the superior standing of our government. Quite a
different system is adopted for the troops under Khans and
Sultans, for there is always an element of uncertainty there;
but in Turkey the army belongs to the Padishah. All Beylerbeys
and officers are his servants, and an Imperial command
is law and can not be trifled with."<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>On this same occasion some of the officers asked whether
the documents which had been taken from me by Ibrahim
Mirza in Meshhed had ever been placed before the Shah.
This question was answered in the affirmative, but I did not
like to pursue the subject, mindful of the saying: "When
evil slumbers, cursed be he who arouses it"—and I turned
the conversation into another channel.</p>

<p>I preferred to plead my cause with another gazel, which
the Shah graciously accepted, and which finally led to the
desired result. We received permission to leave. He wrote
a letter expressive of his unalterable respect and devotion to
his Majesty the Padishah, gave me more presents, and commanded
Nazr Bey, a brother of Yuzbashi Hasan Bey, to accompany
me on the journey.</p>

<p>While in Kazvin I made a pilgrimage to the grave of
Imam Shahzade Husein, and in the beginning of Rebiul Evvel
I started on my journey to Bagdad.</p>

<p>Near to Sultani, we passed Abhar, and I stopped to visit
the grave of Pir Hasan, the son of Akhi Avran, then on to
Kirkan, where I visited the grave of Mohammed Demtiz<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>,
a son of Khodja Ahmed Jesewi, and from there to Derghezin
and Hamadan, in which latter place the graves of Ain-ul-Kuzat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
and Pir Ebulalay, the armor-bearers of the Prophet, were
visited. At Saadabad, our next station, I was met by the
governor, who treated me with marked attention.</p>

<p>Then we took our way by Mount Elvend and Nihavend (in
Suristan) to Bisutun, where I visited the grave of Kiazim,
and in the village Weis-ul-karn, the grave of the saint of that
name. We then proceeded to Kasri-Shirin and through
Kurdistan to the fortress Zendjir. While there we were
much interested in watching a <i>Huma</i> bird<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> high up in the
sky. This is supposed to be a good omen, and we were therefore
well pleased. Some enlarged upon the good fortune
presaged by his appearance, others spoke of the curious properties
of the bird, of whom Sa'di sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"The <i>Huma</i> is distinguished from all other birds,</div>
  <div class="verse">In that he lives on bones, yet is not a bird of prey."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a known fact that this bird feeds exclusively on bones.
The legend says that the <i>Huma</i>, before demolishing a bone,
carries it up high in the air, and then drops it, with the result
that it breaks into many pieces. He then swoops down upon
these, divides them into equal portions, and devours them.
This is the origin of the saying, when Persian officials,
through extortion, obtain more than they can well digest:
"They should follow the example of the <i>Huma</i> bird and divide
their spoils into smaller, equal portions."</p>

<p>Here, at Zendjir, I dismissed Nazr Bey, whom the Shah
had given me as an escort, and after crossing the great river
Tokuz Olum<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> we came to Ban (or Sheri Ban). Toward
the end of the same month of Kebiul Sani we reached Bagdad,
where we were most hospitably received by Khizr Pasha.
We did not delay, however, but hurried on to Turkey.</p>

THE REST OF OUR ADVENTURES</h5>

<p>In the beginning of Djemazi-ul Evvel we crossed the Tigris
in ships, and after revisiting the sacred graves there we journeyed
on. Past Kasri, Semke, and Harbi we came to Tekrit
and Mossul, and by the old road of Mossul and Djizre to
Nisibin. From there by Diarbekir and Mardin we reached
Amed, where I saw Iskender Pasha, who received me most
graciously. In the course of conversation I told him some
of our adventures, to which he listened with much interest,
and exclaimed: "You have gone through more than even
Tamum Dari has done, and as for all the marvelous things
which you have seen, they are beyond the dreams of even
Balkiah and Djihan Shah."</p>

<p>Questioned upon the different sovereigns and armies of the
countries I had visited, I said: "In all the world there is no
country like Turkey, no sovereign like our Padishah, and no
army like the Turkish. From East to West the fame of the
Ottoman troops has spread. For victory follows their banner
wherever they go. May God keep Turkey in wealth and
prosperity until the last day shall dawn. May he preserve
our Padishah in health and happiness and our troops ever
victorious. Amen!"</p>

<p>When asked whether our name was known in those remote
parts, I answered. "Certainly, more than you would think."</p>

<p>In the further course of conversation I learned that a report
of my death had reached the Porte, and that therefore the
post of Egyptian Admiral had been given to Kurdzade, the
Sandjak-bey of Rhodus. I thought to myself: "Long live
my Padishah, I shall easily obtain another office"; and I
comforted myself with poetic effusions. Of course I trusted
in God Almighty, nevertheless I was always thinking about
the conquest of Ormuz and Gujarat, and I argued thus to
myself:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> "These fantastic dreams have so filled thy brain, that
thou art being drawn down to the earth by them; the spirit
of wandering is so strong in thee that thou canst not give thy
body rest until it shall return to dust."</p>

<p>I resumed my journey to Turkey, in the hope soon to set
eyes again on Constantinople. Arrived in Arghini I visited
the grave of the prophet Zilkefl; from there by Kharput to
Malatia and the grave of Seid Ghazi Sultan, a native of that
place, and shortly after I reached Siwas, the first station on
Turkish territory. Ali Pasha received me there with marked
distinction; I delayed a short time to visit the grave of Abdul
Wahab Ghazi, and to call upon Ali Baba, who gave me his
blessing.</p>

<p>After this I continued my journey to Stamboul, across the
plain of Ken to Kara Hissar Behram Shah, and through
Bozauk to Hadji Bektash, where I made pilgrimages to the
graves of the saints of that place, and to Balam Sultan; then
on to Kirshehr and the graves of Hadji Avran and Aashik
Pasha, past Ayas Varsak to Angora, crossing the Kizil Irmak
(Halys) by the bridge of Chashneghir.<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> I visited the grave
of Hadji Bairam Sultan and his children, and the Khidr,
and had a friendly interview with Djenabi Pasha. From
Beybazari we came to Boli, touched Modurn, and on to Kunik,
where is the grave of Sheik Shemseddin; next we came to
Tarakli Yenidje and Keive, with the bridge over the Sakaria
river, past Agadj-Deniz, on to Sabandja and Iznikmid<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and
the grave of Nebi Khodja. From there our way led past
Ghekivize and Skutari, where I crossed the Bosphorus, and
reached Constantinople in safety.</p>

<p>God be praised, who led me safely through manifold dangers,
and brought me back to this most beautiful country of
all the earth. Four years have passed away; years of much
sorrow and misery, of many privations and perplexities; but
now in this year 964 (1556), in the beginning of Redjeb, I
have once more returned to my own people, my relations, and
my friends. Glory and praise be to God the Giver of all
good things!</p>

<p>His Majesty the Padishah happened to be at Adrianople,
and on the second day after my return I traveled thither, to
pay him homage. I had the good fortune to be most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
graciously received by his Imperial Majesty. The high Viziers,
and especially Vizier Rustem Pasha, loaded me with kindnesses.
I was appointed to join the Corps of the <i>Muteferrika</i>
(officers in attendance on the Sultan) with a daily income
of sixty <i>aktche</i>. And the <i>Kethhuda</i> (intendant), who
had accompanied me on my travels, had his salary increased
with eight <i>aktche</i>, and was appointed Muteferrika for
Egypt. One of the Boluk-Bashi (<i>Chef d'Escadron</i>) received
eight <i>aktche</i> and my other traveling companions each six
<i>aktche</i> above their ordinary pay. One of these latter was
nominated to the post of Egyptian <i>Tchaush</i>, and the others
joined the volunteers. They received their pay for the four
years they had been away, payment being made out of the
Egyptian treasury.</p>

<p>Toward the end of Rajab his Majesty the Sultan returned
to Constantinople, and on the day that he entered the Konak
of Tchataldja I was appointed Defterdar of Diarbekir.<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
Thus in his gracious kindness his Majesty had pleased and
satisfied us all.</p>

<p>He who wishes to profit by this narrative let him remember
that not in vain aspirations after greatness, but in a quiet and
contented mind lieth the secret of the true strength which
perisheth not. But if in God's providence he should be
driven from home, and forced to wander forth in the unknown,
and perchance be caught in the turbulent waves of the
sea of adversity, let him still always keep in mind that love
for one's native land is next to one's faith. Let him never
cease to long for the day that he shall see his native shores
again, and always cling loyally to his Padishah.</p>

<p>He who doeth this shall not perish abroad; God will grant
him his desire both in this world and in the next, and he shall
rejoice in the esteem and affection of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

In this Assembly Al Harith arrives in the town of San'a in Yemen,
in great poverty; and, while seeking relief, encounters a crowd, which
is gathered about a preacher. The discourse is a stern warning against
self-indulgence, and an exhortation to repentance. Harith, wishing to
learn who the preacher is, follows him to a cave, and there finds him
enjoying himself with good food, and even with wine. He begins to
rebuke him, but the preacher, throwing off disguise, extemporizes some
lines, confessing that his preaching was only a device to obtain charity.
Harith asks the attendant the name of the preacher, and is told that
he is Abu Zayd, of Seruj.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16_16" href="#FNanchor_16_16" class="label">16</a>
In this Assembly the author displays more than his usual rhetorical
subtlety, and while there is none more admired by those whose
taste has been formed on Eastern models, there is none which appears
more extravagant to the European student. Alliterations, verbal caprices,
far-fetched expressions, and the conceits which were usual
among poets of the age, so abound, that we may almost imagine the
author to be desirous of satirizing what he professes to imitate. The
subject is as follows: Harith in his passion for the society of literary
persons makes his way to Holwan, a town in Irak, on the mountains
east of Bagdad, and a resort of the higher classes from the heat of
the capital. Here he meets with Abu Zayd, who is pursuing his calling
of improvisatore and mendicant under various disguises, and enjoys
for a long time his company and literary guidance. Abu Zayd, however,
disappears, and Harith returns to his native place, Basra, where
after a time he again meets Abu Zayd in the public library, among a
crowd of dilettanti who are discussing the beauties of the popular
poets. The admiration of one is especially excited by a line in which
the teeth of a lady are compared to pearls and hailstones, and the
white petals of a flower; and Abu Zayd instantly produces a number
of comparisons in the same style, which give him a high place in the
esteem of those present, when they are assured that he is really the
author of them. They reward him, and the Assembly concludes by his
reciting to Harith, who had recognized him, some lines on the fickleness
of fortune.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17_17" href="#FNanchor_17_17" class="label">17</a>
Harith is in a circle of scholars, when a lame man makes his appearance,
and after saluting them describes his former affluence and
present penury in a very poetical and figurative style. Harith, perceiving
his genius, and pitying his distress, offers him a denar on
condition that he will improvise some lines in praise of it. This the lame
man at once does, and on Harith offering him another denar on condition
of his blaming it, he recites another composition in dispraise of
money. Harith then recognizes in the lame man Abu Zayd, and rebukes
him for his imposture. Abu Zayd defends himself in some new verses.
The opening address of Abu Zayd is in imitation of a style said to be
common among the Arabs of the desert.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18_18" href="#FNanchor_18_18" class="label">18</a>
Harith is journeying in a caravan to Damietta, and during one of
the night-halts he hears two men conversing on duty toward a neighbor.
The younger being asked for his opinion, replies in a spirit of
charity and generosity, upon which the other rebukes him, and sets
forth the fitting conduct of a man to his neighbor in accordance with
the teachings of selfishness and worldly wisdom. These addresses,
especially that of the elder man, are expressed in a highly rhetorical
diction, which captivates the literary Harith, and the next morning
he looks for them, and discovers them to be Abu Zayd and his
son. He invites them to his own quarters, introduces them to his
friends, and procures for them valuable presents. Abu Zayd then asks
permission to go to a neighboring village and take a bath, promising
to return speedily. They consent, and he goes off with his son. After
waiting the greater part of the day they find that he has deceived
them, and prepare to continue their journey; Harith, when making
ready his camel, finds some lines written on the saddle, which allude
to a precept in the Koran in favor of separating after a meal. The
plays on words in this Assembly are exceedingly ingenious and elaborate,
and the opening description has much poetical beauty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19_19" href="#FNanchor_19_19" class="label">19</a>
The following Assembly, remarkable for the poetical beauty of its
language, and the delicacy of its versification, describes an adventure
in which Abu Zayd obtains a sum of money from a company of generous
scholars. Harith is engaged with some friends in a night conversation
at Kufa, one of the chief seats of Arabian learning, when a
stranger knocks at the door, and addresses the inmates in verses describing
his want and weariness, his excellent disposition, and his
gratitude for the favors he may receive. Struck with his poetical
powers the company admit him, and give him a supper. The lamp
being brought, Harith discovers that the guest is Abu Zayd, and informs
the company of his merits. They then ask him for a story, and
he relates that he had that evening met with a long-lost son, whom he
would be glad to take charge of, did not his poverty hinder him. As
he had taken care to mention in the narrative that he was of the
royal race of Ghassan, the company are moved by his misfortunes, and
at once raise a large sum of money to enable him to support his boy.
Abu Zayd delights them with his conversation, but as soon as daylight
appears he calls away Harith, to assist him in cashing the checks or
orders which he had received. The simple Harith, who had been delighted
with the verses which the father had put into the mouth of
his son, desires to see so eloquent a youth; upon which Abu Zayd
laughs heartily, tells his friend, in some exquisite verses, that such a
desire is the following of a mirage, that he, Abu Zayd, had neither
wife nor son, and that the story was only a trick to obtain money.
He then departs, leaving Harith mortified at the adventure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20_20" href="#FNanchor_20_20" class="label">20</a>
This Assembly is the first of a remarkable series of compositions
which, though they may be set down by Europeans as merely examples
of laborious trifling, are highly esteemed by the Orientals as works of
ingenuity and scholarship, and have found in every succeeding age
numerous imitators. The incident is that Harith, being once on a
visit to Meraghah, in Azerbijan, the northwest province of the present
Persian monarchy, found a number of literary men lamenting the decline
of learning, and depreciating all contemporary authors in comparison
with their predecessors. Sitting in a humble place in the outskirts
of the company was an elderly man, who showed by his glances
and scornful gestures that he did not value highly the opinions of
these critics. When they paused in their fault-finding he took up the
conversation, and declared that one person, at least, of the present age
was capable of rivaling any who had gone before in scholarship and
the arts of composition. He is asked who is this genius, and answers
that it is himself. The company are skeptical, but as the stranger
persists in asserting his great ability, they determine to test him, and
one of them proposes to him a most difficult task. He tells the company
that he is a professional writer attached to the Governor, who,
though a man of generosity, had declared that he would help him no
further, till he had composed an address in which the alternate words
should consist entirely of pointed and unpointed letters; that is, that
the first, third, fifth words, and so forth, should consist of letters
without a point, while the second, fourth, sixth, and so forth, should
have only pointed letters. He adds that he had been striving a whole
year to produce such a composition, or to find some one who could
produce it. The stranger, on hearing this, accepts the task with alacrity,
and instantly dictates an address in praise of the Governor, fulfilling
the conditions that had been imposed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21_21" href="#FNanchor_21_21" class="label">21</a>
This Assembly is well known to students. Harith is at Barka'id.
The feast at the end of Ramadan is approaching, and being desirous
of joining in this solemnity he goes to the public prayer in his best
attire. When the congregation has formed itself into rows, after the
manner of Moslem worship, he espies an old man with his eyes closed,
accompanied by an old woman. The man takes out of a bag a number
of papers curiously written or illuminated in variously colored
inks; and the old woman, going through the rows, presents them to
those whom she guesses from their appearance to be charitably disposed.
One of them falls to the lot of Harith, who finds on it some
strange verses full of alliterations and plays on words. He keeps it,
and when the old woman, being disappointed in her appeal, returns
to reclaim it, he offers her a dirhem on the condition that she will
tell him the name of the author. She informs him that the old man
had composed the verses, and that he was a native of Seruj. Harith
then guesses that he must be Abu Zayd, and is much concerned to
find that he has become blind. When the prayer is over he goes up
to him and discovers that he is indeed Abu Zayd, whereupon he presents
him with a garment and invites him to his house. No sooner
are they in private than Abu Zayd opens his eyes, which are perfectly
sound, and Harith discovers that his pretended blindness was a trick
to excite pity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22_22" href="#FNanchor_22_22" class="label">22</a>
This Assembly, like several others that will be met with in the
course of the work, is so essentially Arabic as almost to forbid intelligible
translation. Two suitors, an old man and a youth, appear before
the Kadi of Ma'arrah. The former narrates to the Kadi that he
had possessed a beautiful and attractive, yet obedient and active, slave
girl; that the youth had borrowed her, treated her roughly, and then
returned her in an infirm state. The youth admits the charge, but
declares that he had offered sufficient compensation; and then complains
that the old man detained as a pledge a male slave of his, who
was of good origin and qualities, and highly serviceable to his master.
The Kadi perceives from the style of these addresses that the language
is enigmatical, and bids the litigants speak plainly. The youth
then improvises some verses to explain that by a slave girl the old
man meant a needle which the youth had borrowed, and the eye of
which he had broken by accident as he was drawing the thread through
it; the male slave which the old man detained was a pencil, or <i>stylus</i>,
for the application of <i>kohl</i>, the dark pigment with which Orientals
anoint the eyelid to heighten by contrast the luster of the eye. The
old man in his turn admits the truth of this, but pleads in mournful
verse his poverty and his inability to bear the loss even of a needle.
The chief feature in the composition is the enigmatical description of
the needle and pencil, which depends on the double meanings of the
words and phrases contained in it. Some of these are so subtle that
even the native commentators are undecided about them; and we may
assume that the <i>double-entente</i> of passages like this was among the
lessons which Hariri is said to have taught to his pupils.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23_23" href="#FNanchor_23_23" class="label">23</a>
The meaning of this passage, when applied to a <i>kohl</i> pencil, is as
follows: I had a <i>kohl</i> pencil, the same at both ends, tracing its
origin to the cutler, free from rust and defect; often brought near
the apple of the eye; it conferred beauty and produced admiration;
it fed the pupil of the eye with ointment, but went not near the
tongue; when it was blackened with the ointment it was liberal of
it, when it marked the eye it beautified it; when it was supplied with
ointment it supplied the eye with it, and when more was required it
added more. It remained not always in its case, and seldom anointed
except two eyes at a time; it gave plentifully of the <i>kohl</i> that was on
it, and was lifted up to the eye for the purpose; it was constantly
attached to the <i>kohl</i>-case, although the two might be of a different
material (that is, the pencil might be of gold and the case of glass or
silver); though it was used for adorning, it was not of a soft substance
but of metal.</p></div>

This is one of the two Assemblies of Hariri which have been translated
and annotated by De Sacy in his Chrestomathy. Harith in his
wanderings comes to Alexandria, and, in accordance with his custom,
makes the acquaintance of the Kadi, who, as appears in the sequel, is
a good-natured and benevolent man. One evening, in winter, the Kadi
is distributing the public alms, when an ill-looking old man is brought
in by a young and handsome woman who accuses him of having married
her on false pretenses. She declares that he had deceived her
father by giving out that he had an excellent trade as a pearl-merchant;
that he had been incautiously accepted, and that now, when it
was too late, she had discovered that he had no business at all. Moreover,
he had taken all her dress and furniture, piece by piece, and
sold it to keep himself in idleness, leaving her and her child to starve.
The Kadi is indignant, and threatens to send the husband to prison,
unless he can clear himself of the charge. The defendant is in no way
disconcerted, but at once improvises some elegant verses, in which he
admits his poverty, and that he had sold his wife's effects, but denies
that he had deceived her in calling himself a "pearl-stringer," for the
pearls which he meant were the pearls of thought, by stringing which
into elegant poems he had been accustomed to make a large income
from the liberality of the rich and noble. Now, however, times were
changed; war and trouble had come upon the earth, and a race of
niggards had succeeded the generous patrons of the old days. The
Kadi accepts the excuse, bids the woman submit herself to her husband,
and gives them some of the alms-money; on receiving which
the old man triumphantly carries off his wife.</p></div>

In this Assembly Abu Zayd is found making gain by his usual
questionable arts. At Rahbah, on the Euphrates, Harith beholds a
crowd following an elderly man who is dragging along a handsome
youth. The former accuses the boy of having killed his son, and it
is agreed to go before the Governor. The purpose of the elder, who
proves in the end to be Abu Zayd, is simply to induce the Governor
to buy off so handsome a youth from punishment, with the view of
taking him into his own household. When they are in court the old
man makes his charge, and as he has no witnesses the boy is allowed
to clear himself by an oath. But the old man dictates an oath in which
he enumerates all the beauties of the boy, and invokes destruction on
them if truth be not spoken. The boy refuses to swear by such an
oath; and the Governor, who desires to take him out of the power of
the old man, then makes up a purse to satisfy the prosecutor. A
hundred denars are promised; but as the whole can not be collected
at once the old man says that he will not give up the boy, but will
watch him all night. The Governor consents, and soon the two are
left together in the courtyard. Harith then accosts Abu Zayd, and
asks who is the boy. Abu Zayd replies, that he is his son, and his
assistant in his tricks; and that they intend to make their escape
early in the morning, and leave the Governor to his disappointment.</p></div>

This and the following Assembly are justly reckoned among the
masterpieces of the author. To pass suddenly from the most solemn
subjects to pleasantry, to place in the mouth of a clever impostor
the most serious warnings that can be addressed to mankind, may be
morally objectionable; but in the Moslem world, where religion is
mixed up with all the concerns of life, and pious discourse and phrases
abound, it excites little repugnance. The design of the author in the
present composition was to produce an elaborate sermon in rhymed
prose and in verse, and his genius takes a higher flight than usual.
The incident on which the Assembly is founded is simple. Harith, in
a fit of religious zeal, betakes himself to the public burial-ground of
the city of Saweh, for the purpose of contemplation. He finds a
funeral in progress, and when it is over, an old man, with his face
muffled in a cloak, takes his stand on a hillock, and pours forth a
discourse on the certainty of death and judgment; rebuking his hearers
for their worldly selfishness, and warning them that wealth and
power are of little avail against the general leveler. He then rises
into poetry and declaims a piece which is one of the noblest productions
of Arabic literature. In lofty morality, in religious fervor, in
beauty of language, in power and grace of meter, this magnificent
hymn is unsurpassed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27_27" href="#FNanchor_27_27" class="label">27</a>
Harith, being in affluence, crosses from Irak to Damascus to enjoy
the luxury of that city. After he has had his fill of pleasure he bethinks
himself of returning homeward, and joins a caravan that is
about to cross the Semaweh, the desert which lies between Syria and
the Euphrates. The travelers are ready to depart, but are delayed by
their inability to find an escort, which they think indispensable for
their protection against robbers. While they are consulting they are
watched by a dervish, who at last announces to them that he has the
means of keeping them safe from harm; and, on their inquiring
further, tells them that his safeguard is a magic form of words revealed
to him in a dream. They are at first incredulous, but at length
consent to take him with them, and to use his incantation. He then
repeats it, and it proves to be a prayer full of assonances and rhymes,
beseeching the general protection of the Almighty. They all learn it
by heart and then set forth, repeating it twice a day on their journey.
As they are not molested on the road they judge the charm to have
been successful; and when they come in sight of 'Anah, the first town
on the other side of the desert, they reward him richly with what he
likes best, gold and jewels. When he has taken all he can get, he
makes his escape, and the next thing they hear of him is that he is
drinking in the taverns of 'Anah, a city celebrated for its wine. Harith,
shocked at this enormity in a pious dervish, determines to seek him
out, and soon finds him reveling amid wine and music in the guest-chamber
of a wine-shop. He taxes him with his wickedness, and then
the old man improvises a Bacchanalian chant, which is one of the finest
pieces in Hariri's work. In form this poem resembles that which is
introduced into the last Assembly, though the meter is more light and
lively, as Hariri, no doubt, desired to display his genius by the contrast.
This Assembly is one of the most admired productions of the
author, who has lavished on it all the resources of his marvelous
rhetoric.</p></div>

Maisuna was a daughter of the tribe of Calab; a tribe, according
to Abulfeda, remarkable both for the purity of dialect spoken in it,
and for the number of poets it had produced. She was married, whilst
very young, to the Caliph Mowiah. But this exalted situation by no
means suited the disposition of Maisuna, and amidst all the pomp and

instead of concealing his vices from the eyes of his subjects, he seemed
to make a parade of those actions which he knew no good Mussulman
could look upon without horror; he drank wine in public, he caressed
his dogs, and was waited upon by his eunuchs in sight of the whole

in a party of pleasure along with Barkaidy, Ebn Fahdi, Abou
Jaber, and the improvisatore poet, Ebn Alramacram, resolved to divert
himself at the expense of his companions. He therefore ordered the
poet to give a specimen of his talents, which at the same time should
convey a satire upon the three courtiers, and a compliment to himself.
Ebn Alramacram took his subject from the stormy appearance of the
night, and immediately produced these verses.</p></div>

their own wisdom. The Arab philosophers were, amongst their
kind, something like the <i>libertins</i> of the seventeenth century in France.
"Often," says Al Ghazali, "I have seen one read the Koran, assist at
religious ceremonies and prayers, and praise religion aloud. When I
asked him, 'If you consider prophetism as false, why do you pray!'
he responded, 'It is an exercise of the body, a custom of the country,
a method of having your life saved.' Yet he did not cease from drinking
wine, and delivering himself to all sorts of abominations and impieties."</p></div>

Our author, according to the spirit of the age, was not only a
brave warrior and sailor, but also a poet, using the East-Turkish Dialect
(Djagatai). His muse has no special features, and with regard
to his choice of words they betray a strong tendency toward the
Osmanli dialect. It is nevertheless interesting to note in how short
a time he mastered this dialect and that, more than 100 years after
Baber, the Djagatai tongue maintained itself as the court-and-book-language
in India. In our translation we necessarily omit these poetic
effusions as irrelevant.</p></div>

Opinions differ as to the exact nature of the <i>Tughra</i> (signature of
Turkish rulers: more correctly, <i>tora</i>, meaning "decree"). Some say
that it is merely a flourish, others hold that it is the impression of
the hand. In Central Asia, Turkish monarchs used to dip their hand
in blood, hence the expression <i>al-tamga</i>, "red seal." The descendants
of Baber first introduced into India the use of the yellow dye, saffron.</p></div>

Elphinstone in the "History of India" relates his death as follows:
"He had been walking on the terrace of his library, and was
descending the stairs (which in such situations are narrow steps on
the outside of the building and only guarded by an ornamental parapet
about a foot high). Hearing the call to prayers from the minarets,
he stopped, as is usual on such occasions, repeated the creed, and sat
down on the steps till the crier had done. He then endeavored to rise,
supporting himself on his staff; the staff slipped on the polished marble
of the steps, and the King fell headlong over the parapet. He was
stunned at the time and, although he soon recovered his senses, the
injury he had received was beyond cure. On the fourth day after his
accident he expired in the forty-ninth year of his age and the twenty-sixth
of his reign, including the 16 years of his banishment from his
capital."</p></div>

From the political condition already referred to, it is quite evident
why our author chose this very difficult, roundabout route past
Badakhshan, the same route which was taken by Sheibani Khan, Baber's
adversary, during his campaign against Khosru Shah. Part of
ancient Khatlan, also called Khotl, is now included in the Province of
Kulab.</p></div>

Neither Charsui nor Pul-i-Senghin are to be found on any modern

the Kafirnihan river was then the boundary-line of Transoxania.</p></div>

Borak Khan, a son of Mahmud Khan, who was defeated by Sheibani.
He was a native of the steppes in the northeast of Transoxania,
and, favored by the bad government of Burhan Khan, he and his
horsemen, consisting of Kirghises and Kalmuks, invaded the land, and
took possession of the capital, Samarkand. He died in the year 1555.
The incidents connected with his reign, which our author mentions,
are the more valuable to us as we find no mention of them anywhere
else.</p></div>

When in Samarkand I could learn nothing about the cloak and
the <i>Naalin</i> (wooden shoes) of the Prophet, but the copy of the Koran
here referred to was extant in the Mausoleum of Timur. This latter,
however, although a very old manuscript in Kufi letters, has not descended
from Caliph Ali, nor yet from Caliph Osman; it has been
brought to Turkestan by the descendants of Khodja Ahrar, and from
Samarkand the Russians took it to St. Petersburg.</p></div>

At that time the King of Persia was Thamasp Shah, and it so

<i>Istikhare</i>, "horoscope," is consulted by opening the Koran at hazard
and the passage at which it opens gives the answer. Another way

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_196_196" href="#FNanchor_196_196" class="label">196</a>
This passage is of special geographical interest. As our author
came from Kharezm, on the left shore of the Oxus, and crossed the
river on his way to Khorassan, he refers here undoubtedly to the old
course of this river, mentioned by Abulgazi. As the Oxus, in its course
down-stream from Tchardjui, reveals several old river-beds, the direction
here indicated by Sidi Ali must be one of the two courses which
ran either from Hezaresp or from Khanka in southwesterly direction
into the Caspian Sea. Most likely it was the latter branch, as it was
at that time the more important of the two, and, according to Abulgazi,
culture had reached a considerable height along its shores.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_197_197" href="#FNanchor_197_197" class="label">197</a>

Curiously enough, the same custom still prevails in Persia, for
when I visited this land three hundred years later, disguised as an
Osmanli, I had much to suffer from the indiscretion of the Shiite
fanatics. By night and by day, on the march and at rest, it was always
this same vexed question of the succession, which had to be
discussed.</p></div>

It appears from this passage that the Pilgrims' route from Central
Asia to Mecca led in those days past Astrakhan, <i>i.e.</i>, by Kharezm and

travel by the Trans-Caspian line, via Batum Baku and Constantinople

Our author refers here to the Feudal system still in use in Central
Asia at the time that I was there, and he rightly criticizes the
limited power of the rulers, which is the necessary result of it. In
Persia the relation between the Khans and the Shah was based upon
this principle till quite within modern times. The Sultans of Turkey,
when at the zenith of their power, were absolute sovereigns of their
land. But at the commencement of the decline the same relationship
was established there, as we see from the conduct of the Derebeys.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
